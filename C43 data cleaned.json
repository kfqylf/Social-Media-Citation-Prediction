This study utilized an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model to examine how Facebook maintenance and surveillance affect friendship quality. Bryant and Marmo's (2012) Facebook maintenance scale was evaluated, revealing two factors: sharing and caring. Facebook surveillance was also measured. For friendship satisfaction and liking, significant positive actor and partner effects emerged for caring; significant negative actor, partner, and interaction effects emerged for sharing; and significant positive actor effects emerged for surveillance. For friendship closeness, significant positive actor effects emerged for caring and surveillance.",

        "abstract":"Abstract Large increase or hike in energy prices has proven to impact electricity consumption in a way which cannot be drawn from historical data, especially when price elasticity of demand is not significant. This paper proposes an integrated adaptive fuzzy inference system (FIS) to estimate and forecast long-term electricity consumption when prices experience large increase. To this end, first a novel procedure for construction and adaptation of Takagi\u2013Sugeno fuzzy inference system (TS-FIS) is suggested. Logarithmic linear regressions are estimated with historical data and used to construct an initial first-order TS-FIS. Then, in the adaptation phase, expert knowledge is used to define new fuzzy rules which form a new secondary FIS for electricity forecasting. To show the applicability and usefulness of the proposed model, it is applied for forecasting of annual electricity consumption in Iran where removing energy subsidies has resulted in a hike in electricity prices. Gross domestic product (GDP), population and electricity price are three inputs for the initial TS-FIS. A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect the expert estimation on possible change in electricity per capita, change in electricity intensity and the ratio of GDP elasticity to population elasticity when price hikes. Based on the information collected, a fuzzy rule base is formed and used to construct the secondary FIS which is used for electricity forecasting until 2016. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model of this paper is compared with three other models namely ANFIS, ANN and one-stage regression in terms of their mean absolute percentage error. The comparison shows a superior performance for the proposed FIS model.",

        "abstract":"Providing consistent security services in on-demand provisioned Cloud infrastructure services is of primary importance due to multi-tenant and potentially multi-provider nature of Clouds Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment. Cloud security infrastructure should address two aspects of the IaaS operation and dynamic security services provisioning: (1) provide security infrastructure for secure Cloud IaaS operation, (2) provisioning dynamic security services, including creation and management of the dynamic security associations, as a part of the provisioned composite services or virtual infrastructures. The first task is a traditional task in security engineering, while dynamic provisioning of managed security services in virtualised environment remains a problem and requires additional research. In this paper we discuss both aspects of the Cloud Security and provide suggestions about required security mechanisms for secure data management in dynamically provisioned Cloud infrastructures. The paper refers to the architectural framework for on-demand infrastructure services provisioning, being developed by authors, that provides a basis for defining the proposed Cloud Security Infrastructure. The proposed SLA management solution is based on the WS-Agreement and allows dynamic SLA management during the whole provisioned services lifecycle. The paper discusses conceptual issues, basic requirements and practical suggestions for dynamically provisioned access control infrastructure (DACI). The paper proposes the security mechanisms that are required for consistent DACI operation, in particular security tokens used for access control, policy enforcement and authorisation session context exchange between provisioned infrastructure services and Cloud provider services. The suggested implementation is based on the GAAA Toolkit Java library developed by authors that is extended with the proposed Common Security Services Interface (CSSI) and additional mechanisms for binding sessions and security context between provisioned services and virtualised platform.",

        "abstract":"Reference immutability ensures that a reference is not used to modify the referenced object, and enables the safe sharing of object structures. A pure method does not cause side-effects on the objects that existed in the pre-state of the method execution. Checking and inference of reference immutability and method purity enables a variety of program analyses and optimizations. We present ReIm, a type system for reference immutability, and ReImInfer, a corresponding type inference analysis. The type system is concise and context-sensitive. The type inference analysis is precise and scalable, and requires no manual annotations. In addition, we present a novel application of the reference immutability type system: method purity inference. To support our theoretical results, we implemented the type system and the type inference analysis for Java. We include a type checker to verify the correctness of the inference result. Empirical results on Java applications and libraries of up to 348kLOC show that our approach achieves both scalability and precision.",

        "abstract":"When using MLP regression models, some method for estimating the generalisation ability is required to identify badly over- and under-fitted models. If data is limited, it may be impossible to spare sufficient data for a test set, and leave-one-out cross-validation may be considered as an alternative method for estimating generalisation ability. However, this method is very computer intensive, and we suggest a faster, approximate version suitable for use with the MLP. This approximate method is tested using an artificial test problem, and is then applied to a real modelling problem from the paper-making industry. It is shown that the basic method appears to work quite well, but that the approximation may be poor under certain conditions. These conditions and possible means of improving the approximation are discussed in some detail.",

In this paper, two semantic-based self-organized algorithms aimed at taxonomy hierarchy semantic space are proposed, which can dynamically partition the network into distinct semantic clusters according to network load, with semantic relationship among data within a cluster and load balance among clusters all well maintained. The experiment indicates good performance and scalability of these two clustering algorithms.",

        "abstract":"Access control for semi-structured data is nontrivial, as witnessed by the number of access control approaches in literature. Recently, a case has been made for expressing access constraints at finer levels of granularity on data nodes and extending constraints to structural relationships. In this paper, we introduce a rewrite-based approach for access constraint enforcement, based on the ACXESS framework we developed at Indiana University. The ACXESS framework utilizes virtual security views and introduces a set of rewrite rules that takes advantage of the Security Annotated Schema (SAS) - an internal representation for virtual views. It is capable of rewriting user queries against security views into queries against the source data, while honoring the access constraints.",

        "abstract":"The design of a linear, fully-balanced, voltage-tunable CMOS operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) with improved gain and very wide bandwidth is described. It uses a cross-coupled, two-differential-pair transconductor together with a negative resistance load for compensating the parasitic output resistance of the OTA. Since no additional internal nodes are generated DC-gain enhancement is obtained without any bandwidth limitation. SPICE simulation results show THD<1% at 1.9 Vp-p with dynamic range equal to 63 dB at a power consumption of 2.7 mW from a single 5-V supply. Application to a lowpass filter in the VHF range is presented as an example, assuming implementation in a standard 2 \u03bcm CMOS process (MOSIS). The cutoff frequency of the filter is tunable in the range of 8.3-50.0 MHz",

        "abstract":"CDN interconnection is currently being debated across industry, academia and standards organizations, both in terms of proposing mechanisms for inter-CDN cooperation, such as architectures and protocols, and in terms of the conditions under which cooperation is advantageous. In this paper we focus on the second part and provide contributions to the fundamental problem of when two CDNs should cooperate. Given two CDNs, we aim at quantifying the loss in provisioning efficiency that arises from inter-CDN cooperation. We solve a CDN placement problem in interconnection scenarios, in order to compare the cost of centrally provisioning a network with the joint cost of provisioning the same topology but partitioned and with both sub-topologies independently and only locally optimally provisioned. Given the complexity of the topic (particularly the computational cost) but also aiming at general figures of merit, we use a non-capacitated K-median problem and solve the problem for a large number of topologies. Among other results, we show that the incurred inefficiency of provisioning the same topology partitioned in two independent CDNs, but locally optimal, can raise up to 30%. Overall, we demonstrate with exact solutions that interconnection may not be straightforwardly advantageous.",

        "abstract":"2D convolution is a staple of digital image processing. The advent of large format imagers makes it possible to literally \"pave\" with silicon the focal plane of an optical sensor, which results in very large images that can require a significant amount computation to process. Filtering of large images via 2D convolutions is often complicated by a variety of effects (e.g., non-uniformities found in wide field of view instruments) which must be compensated for in the filtering process by changing the filter across the image. This paper describes a fast (FFT based) method for convolving images with slowly varying filters. A parallel version of the method is implemented using a multi-threaded approach, which allows more efficient load balancing and a simpler software architecture. The method has been implemented within a high level interpreted language (IDL), while also exploiting open standards vector libraries (VSIPL) and open standards parallel directives (OpenMP). The parallel approach and software architecture are generally applicable to a variety of algorithms and has the advantage of enabling users to obtain the convenience of an easy operating environment while also delivering high performance using a fully portable code.",

In this paper, the connection between attack-defense trees and game theory is made explicit. We show that attack-defense trees and binary zero-sum two-player extensive form games have equivalent expressive power when considering satisfiability, in the sense that they can be converted into each other while preserving their outcome and their internal structure.",

        "abstract":"Extracting sentiment from Twitter data is one of the fundamental problems in social media analytics. Twitter's length constraint renders determining the positive\/negative sentiment of a tweet difficult, even for a human judge. In this work we present a general framework for per-tweet (in contrast with batches of tweets) sentiment analysis which consists of: (1) extracting tweets about a desired target subject, (2) separating tweets with sentiment, and (3) setting apart positive from negative tweets. For each step, we study the performance of a number of classical and new machine learning algorithms. We also show that the intrinsic sparsity of tweets allows performing classification in a low dimensional space, via random projections, without losing accuracy. In addition, we present weighted variants of all employed algorithms, exploiting the available labeling uncertainty, which further improve classification accuracy. Finally, we show that spatially aggregating our per-tweet classification results produces a very satisfactory outcome, making our approach a good candidate for batch tweet sentiment analysis.",

        "abstract":"Structured peer-to-peer systems have emerged as infrastructures for resource sharing in large-scale, distributed, and dynamic environments. One challenge in these systems is to efficiently maintain routing information in the presence of nodes joining, leaving, and failing. Many systems use costly periodic stabilization protocols to ensure that the routing information is up-to-date. In this paper, we present a novel technique called correction-on-change, which identifies and notifies all nodes that have outdated routing information as a result of a node joining, leaving, or failing. Effective failure handling is simplified as the detection of a failure triggers a correction-on-change which updates all the nodes that have a pointer to the failed node. The resulting system has increased robustness as nodes with stale routing information are immediately updated. We proof the correctness of the algorithms and evaluate its performance by means of simulation. Experimental results show that for the same amount of maintenance bandwidth correction-on-change makes the system by far more robust when compared to periodic stabilization. Moreover, compared to adaptive stabilization which adjusts its frequency to the dynamism in the system, correction-on-change gives the same performance but with considerably less maintenance bandwidth. As correction-on-change immediately updates incorrect routing entries the average lookup length is maintained close to the theoretical average in the presence of high dynamism. We show how the technique can be applied to our DKS system as well as the Chord system.",

        "abstract":"The shortest path routing problem is a multiobjective nonlinear optimization problem with a set of constraints. This problem has been addressed by considering delay and cost objectives simultaneously and as a weighted sum of both objectives for comparison. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms can find multiple pareto-optimal solutions in one single run and this ability makes them attractive for solving problems with multiple and conflicting objectives. This paper uses an elitist multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA), for solving the dynamic shortest path routing problem in computer networks. A priority-based encoding scheme is proposed for population initialization. Elitism ensures that the best solution does not deteriorate in the succeeding generations. Results for a sample test network have been presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach to generate well-distributed pareto-optimal solutions of dynamic routing problem in one single run. The results obtained by NSGA are compared with single objective weighting factor method for which genetic algorithm (GA) is applied.",

We have developed UbiK, an alternative portable text-entry method that allows user to type on a piece of paper, placed on solid surfaces like wood desktop. UbiK leverages the microphones on a mobile device to accurately localize the keystrokes through fine-grained acoustic fingerprinting. We have implemented UbiK as an Android application. Our experiments demonstrate that UbiK is able to achieve above 95% of localization accuracy. In this demonstration, we will show how Ubik works with an external paper keyboard (Figure 1) for a smartphone and a 7-inch tablet. User participation will be welcome in this live demo.",

        "abstract":"The IBM RISC System\/6000, a superscalar microprocessor, is presented. The architecture of this processor has its instruction set specifically designed for a superscalar machine containing three independent units-branch, fixed-point, and floating-point. The design also emphasizes high-performance floating-point operations. The design principles are to offer maximum overlap of the three functional units, avoid dead cycles, and define instructions that can (for the most part) be completed at a rate of one per cycle. The branch cycle, fixed- and floating-point units, cache management, and performance are described. Benchmark results are given.",

        "abstract":"The main goal of this paper is to study the feasibility of a novel implantable micro-system able to record information about tendon sliding movements by using contactless measurement devices (magnetic sources and sensors). The system, named \"Biomechatronic Position Transducer\" (BPT), can be used for the implementation of advanced control strategies in neuroprostheses. After a preliminary analysis based on finite element model simulations, an experimental setup was developed in order to simulate the recording conditions (the sensors fixed to the bones and the magnetic sources placed on the tendons). In order to limit the number of implanted components of the system, a fuzzy Mamdani-like architecture was developed to extract the information from the raw data. The results confirm the possibility of using the presented approach for developing an implantable micro-sensor able to extract kinematic information useful for the control of neuroprostheses. Future works will go in the direction of integrating and testing the sensors and the electronic circuitry (to provide power supply and to record the data) during in vitro and in situ experiments.",

        "abstract":"We introduce and study adapted list coloring of graphs and hypergraphs. This is a generalization of ordinary list coloring and adapted coloring, and has more applications than these. We prove that the upper bounds on the adaptable choosability of graphs and uniform hypergraphs in terms of maximum degree are sufficiently stronger than those on the ordinary choosability, while the bounds in terms of degeneracy are the same. We also characterize simple graphs with adaptable choosability $2$.",

        "abstract":"The Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama rule is the classical formula for computing the character table of Sn. Y. Roichman (Adv. Math. 129 (1997) 25) has recently discovered a rule for the Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig characters of q Hecke algebras of type A, which can also be used for the character table of Sn. For each of the two rules, we give an algorithm for computing entries in the character table of Sn. We then analyze the computational complexity of the two algorithms, and in the case of characters indexed by partitions in the (k,\u2113) hook, compare their complexities to each other. It turns out that the algorithm based on the Murnaghan\u2013Nakayama rule requires far less operations than the other algorithm. We note the algorithms\u2019 complexities\u2019 relation to two enumeration problems of Young diagrams and Young tableaux.",

Es wird kurz ein Werkzeug vorgestellt, mit welchem wir die Zugriffe der Studierenden auf die Vorle- sungsaufzeichnungen untersucht haben. Die aufschlussreichsten Analysen werden in diesem Beitrag vorgestellt. Es ergeben sich hierbei interessante Ergebnisse bezuglich der Verwendung der Materialien durch die Studierenden oder der Nachfrage nach ver- schiedenen Medienformaten. Auch das immer wieder kontrovers diskutierte Thema, ob Vorlesungsaufzeichnungen mit Dozentenvideo besser geeignet sind als Aufzeich- nungen ohne das Video, wird von uns aufgegriffen und die Position unserer Studieren- den zu dieser Thematik anhand der Logfileanalyse dargelegt. Des Weiteren diskutieren wir das Thema der Archivierung von Vorlesungsaufzeichnungen und untersuchen, zu welchen Zeitpunkten Studierende besonders auf Vorlesungsaufzeichnungen als Lern- material zur\u00a8 uckgreifen.",

        "abstract":"Localization is a fundamental issue of wireless sensor networks that has been extensively studied in the literature. The real-world experience from GreenOrbs, a sensor network system in the forest, shows that localization in the wild remains very challenging due to various interfering factors. In this paper we propose CDL, a Combined and Differentiated Localization approach. The central idea is that ranging quality is the key that determines the overall localization accuracy. In its unremitting pursuit of better ranging quality, CDL incorporates virtual-hop localization, local filtration, and ranging-quality aware calibration. We have implemented CDL and evaluated it by extensive experiments and simulations. The results demonstrate that CDL outperforms current state-of-art approaches with better accuracy, efficiency and consistent performance.",

        "abstract":"In wireless networks, how to provide reliable data transfer is an important and challenging issue due to channel fading and interference. Several approaches, e.g., Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) and Network Coding (NC), are used to enhance reliability of transmission in wireless networks. However, we note that these schemes implement the data recovery process for mixed unicast and multicast (MUM) communications by simply separating the process into two phases, unicast and multicast phase. This is inefficient and expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient retransmission scheme with network coding for MUM transmission, aiming at improving bandwidth utilization. UMNC searches for coding opportunities from both unicast and multicast flows, which offer the potential benefit of improved recovery in the event of packet loss. We theoretically prove that UMNC can effectively reduce the total number of retransmissions and thus improve bandwidth efficiency, compared with existing schemes.

Therefore, there is a growing interest in helping user better find, filter, and manage these resources. Language identification is the first step of understanding text documents which is written in. It is usually a module within multilingual application. In this paper, we introduce language identification of Arabic script documents by letter frequency. Technique used for identification is fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART), which is belong to the neural network architectures that perform incremental unsupervised learning. Arabic script documents such as Arabic, Persian and Urdu were used for performing language identification. From the experiments, we have found that fuzzy ART is particularly promising in terms of accuracy on language identification.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we describe a new methodology for defining brain regions-of-interset (ROIs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The ROIs are defined based on their functional connectivity to other ROIs, i.e., ROIs are defined as sets of voxels with similar connectivity patterns to other ROIs. The method relies on 1) a spatially regularized canonical correlation analysis for identifying maximally correlated signals, which are not due to correlated noise; 2) a test for merging ROIs which have similar connectivity patterns to the other ROIs; and 3) a graph-cuts optimization for assigning voxels to ROIs. Since our method is fully connectivity-based, the extracted ROIs and their corresponding time signals are ideally suited for a subsequent brain connectivity analysis.",

        "abstract":"The frequent problem in low-level vision arises from the goal to eliminate noise and uninteresting details from an image, without blurring semantically important structures such as edges. Partial differential equations (PDEs) have recently dominated image processing research, as a very good tool for noise elimination, image enhancement and edge detection. In this paper, we present a biased PDE filter based on a coupling between shock filter and curvature diffusion. This model removes noise and sharpens edges efficiently. It preserves well the location of the shocks by synchronising both effects of smoothing and deblurring. Empirical results on different kinds of images confirm these advantages.",

        "abstract":"We study the problem of clustering uncertain objects whose locations are described by probability density functions (pdf). We show that the UK-means algorithm, which generalises the k-means algorithm to handle uncertain objects, is very inefficient. The inefficiency comes from the fact that UK-means computes expected distances (ED) between objects and cluster representatives. For arbitrary pdf's, expected distances are computed by numerical integrations, which are costly operations. We propose pruning techniques that are based on Voronoi diagrams to reduce the number of expected distance calculation. These techniques are analytically proven to be more effective than the basic bounding-box-based technique previous known in the literature. We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our pruning techniques and to show that our techniques significantly outperform previous methods.",

In this paper, a simple tamper localization and recovery scheme that uses lossless compression was proposed. Lossy compression may also be applied when necessary.

        "abstract":"Exiting cost estimation models suffer from several limitations. First, static cost model is not capable of reflecting real-time situations. Second, dynamic cost model is not scalable due to its extensive probe queries. Third, these models are not designed for ad-hoc systems such as P2P, since dynamism of peers is not taken into consideration. In this paper, first, we propose a progressive \u201cpush-based\u201d remote cost monitoring approach. We derive a generic static cost model from conventional static approach. Agents will be sent to remote hosts with a generic cost model and epsilons (\u03b5) indicating the acceptable magnitude of cost change, i.e., percentage of coefficient changed. An update will be sent (pushed) to original host once the magnitude of the cost changes exceeds . Second, we introduce a fuzzy cost evaluation metric in additional to traditional evaluation criteria for handling the dynamism of P2P systems. This metric gives a confident measurement of a peer\u2019s reliability.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents architectures and implementation of a Sliding Memory Plane (SliM) Image Processor to build a SIMD parallel computer. The paper also proposes an enhanced multiplication algorithm to reduce the gate count and the number of cycles. The SliM chip consists of mesh-connected 5\u00d75 PEs. Due to the idea of sliding , that is, overlapping the inter-PE communication time with the computation time, SliM can greatly reduce the inter-PE communication overhead. In addition, four operations corresponding to ALU, shift, data I\/O, and inter-PE communication can be grouped into an instruction to be executed in a cycle simultaneously. The implemented SliM chip operates at 25 MHz and gives 625 MIPS. Because of a mesh topology, a large number of chips can be easily connected to form a SIMD parallel computer. We have implemented the scalable SliM Array Processor and developed parallel algorithms for real-time image processing.",

        "abstract":"Citation indictors are increasingly used in some subject areas to support peer review in the evaluation of researchers and departments. Nevertheless, traditional journal-based citation indexes may be inadequate for the citation impact assessment of book-based disciplines. This article examines whether online citations from Google Books and Google Scholar can provide alternative sources of citation evidence. To investigate this, we compared the citation counts to 1,000 books submitted to the 2008 U.K. Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) from Google Books and Google Scholar with Scopus citations across seven book-based disciplines (archaeology; law; politics and international studies; philosophy; sociology; history; and communication, cultural, and media studies). Google Books and Google Scholar citations to books were 1.4 and 3.2 times more common than were Scopus citations, and their medians were more than twice and three times as high as were Scopus median citations, respectively. This large number of citations is evidence that in book-oriented disciplines in the social sciences, arts, and humanities, online book citations may be sufficiently numerous to support peer review for research evaluation, at least in the United Kingdom. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The contribution is a new metric distance and all the tools necessary to be used within the iterative closest point framework. The metric distance is defined in the configuration space of the sensor, and takes into account both translation and rotation error of the sensor. The new scan matching technique ameliorates previous methods in terms of robustness, precision, convergence, and computational load. Furthermore, it has been extensively tested to validate and compare this technique with existing methods",

        "abstract":"Earlier research has proved that a finite amount of energy dissipation would occur if the computation is devoid of reversible logic. In the light of this problem, a binary parallel adder-subtractor using reversible logic is proposed. The proposed circuit has the ability to add and subtract two 4-bit binary, numbers depending on the mode bit M This circuit can be generalized for N bit addition and subtraction. The proposed design technique uses minimum number of gates as well as garbage outputs thereby significantly reducing the circuit complexity.",

        "abstract":"Due to the explosive increase in the amount of information in computer systems, we need a system that can process large amounts of data efficiently. Cloud computing system is an effective means to achieve this capacity and has spread throughout the world. In our research, we focus on hybrid cloud environments, and we propose a method for efficiently processing large amounts of data while responding flexibly to needs related to performance and costs. We have developed this method as middleware. For data-intensive jobs using this system, we have created a benchmark that can determine the saturation of the system resources deterministically. Using this benchmark, we can determine the parameters in this middleware. This middleware can provide Pareto optimal cost load balancing based on the needs of the user. The results of the evaluation indicate the success of the system. We then compare the processing time when these jobs are processed sequentially and the processing time using this measurement.",

In our evolutionary-algorithm (EA) based solution, various methods are considered in order to incorporate specialized operators for hybridization, including problem-specific heuristics for initial population generation, intelligent variation operators (contribution-based-crossover operator and proximity-based-crossover operator), which comprise problem-specific knowledge, and a local-search phase. The experimental study validates finding the optimal balance among visibility-oriented, stealth-oriented, and cost-oriented objectives. The obtained results also indicate the effectiveness and robustness of our HEA-based solution for various practical scenarios with different objectives.",

In this paper we explore the use of general disjunctions for branching when solving linear programs with general-integer variables. We give computational results that show that the size of the enumeration tree can be greatly reduced by branching on such disjunctions rather than on single variables.",

We propose a multiresolution model for the representation and visualization of such dataset, based on a decomposition of the three-dimensional domain into tetrahedra. Multiresolution is achieved through a sequence of tetrahedralizations that approximate the scalar field at increasing precision. The construction of the model is based on an adaptive incremental approach driven by the local coherence of the scalar field. The proposed model allows an efficient extraction of compact isosurfaces with adaptive resolution levels as well as the development of progressive and multiresolution rendering approaches. Experimental evaluations of the proposed approach on different scattered datasets are reported.",

        "abstract":"Probably the popular form of binary genetic algorithms for function optimization use tournament selection (TS) or roulette wheel selection (RS) for function optimization. Also single point crossover (SC) and uniform crossover (UC) are most popular and effective crossover operators. In an earlier paper we had considered all four combinations of these crossover and mutation operators along with bit-wise mutation, called GA1 (TS+SC), GA2 (TS+UC), GA3 (RS+SC) and GA4 (RS+UC). In this paper, an attempt is made to hybridize these four GAs by incorporating the quadratic approximation (QA) operator into them. The four resultant hybrid GAs, called HGA1, HGA2, HGA3 and HGA4, are compared with the four simple GAs on a set of 22 test problems taken from literature. Based on the extensive numerical and graphical analysis of results it is concluded that the HGA3 outperforms all rest 7 versions. Further, we study the depth and frequency of the QA should be applied for better performance for the particular problem suite.",

        "abstract":"Video encoding to yield a decoder-friendly H.264 bit stream that consumes less decoding power yet with little coding efficiency degradation is investigated in this work. The energy saving of the decoder relies on the use of adaptive deblocking filters (ADF). We first propose a power consumption model for the deblocking filter. Then, the encoder performs the rate-distortion-decoder complexity optimization (RDC) to save the decoder power needed for deblocking filter operations, which is called the decoder-friendly adaptive deblocking filter (DF-ADF) mode decision. The RDC optimization framework presents a way to balance coding efficiency and the ADF decoding cost in the mode decision process. The effectiveness of the proposed DF-ADF algorithm is demonstrated by experiments with diverse video contents and bit rates.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Small RNAs are known to regulate diverse gene expression processes including translation, transcription, and splicing. Among small RNAs, the microRNAs (miRNAs) of 17 to 27 nucleotides (nts) undergo biogeneses including primary transcription, RNA excision and folding, nuclear export, cytoplasmic processing, and then bioactivity as regulatory agents. We propose that analogous hairpins from RNA molecules that function as part of the spliceosome might also be the source of small, regulatory RNAs (somewhat smaller than miRNAs). RESULTS: Deep sequencing technology has enabled discovery of a novel 16-nt RNA sequence in total RNA from human brain that we propose is derived from RNU1, an RNA component of spliceosome assembly. Bioinformatic alignments compel inquiring whether the novel 16-nt sequence or its precursor have a regulatory function as well as determining aspects of how processing intersects with the miRNA biogenesis pathway. Specifically, our preliminary in silico investigations reveal the sequence could regulate splicing factor Arg\/Ser rich 1 (SFRS1), a gene coding an essential protein component of the spliceosome. All 16-base source sequences in the UCSC Human Genome Browser are within the 14 instances of RNU1 genes listed in wgEncodeGencodeAutoV3. Furthermore, 10 of the 14 instances of the sequence are also within a common 28-nt hairpin-forming subsequence of RNU1. CONCLUSIONS: An abundant 16-nt RNA sequence is sourced from a spliceosomal RNA, lies in a stem of a predicted RNA hairpin, and includes reverse complements of subsequences of the 3'UTR of a gene coding for a spliceosome protein. Thus RNU1 could function both as a component of spliceosome assembly and as inhibitor of production of the essential, spliceosome protein coded by SFRS1. Beyond this example, a general procedure is needed for systematic discovery of multiple alignments of sequencing, splicing, and RNA folding data.",

        "abstract":"This paper proposes a simple and reliable method termed the Difference Operation Method (DOM) to detect the QRS complex of an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The proposed DOM includes two stages. The first stage is to find the point R by applying the difference equation operation to an ECG signal. The second stage looks for the points Q and S based on the point R to find the QRS complex. From the QRS complex, the T wave and P wave can be obtained by the existing methods. Some records (QRS complex and T and P waves) of ECG signals in MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is tested to show the DOM has a much more precise detection rate and faster speed than other methods.",

        "abstract":"The paper introduces and studies numerical methods that are fully adaptive in both three-dimensional (3D) space and time to challenging multiscale cardiac reaction-diffusion models. In these methods, temporal adaptivity comes via stepsize control in function space oriented linearly implicit time integration, while spatial adaptivity is realized within multilevel finite element methods controlled by a posteriori local error estimators. In contrast to other recent adaptivity approaches to cardiac modeling that discretize first in space and then in time (so-called method of lines), our method discretizes first in time and then in space (so-called Rothe method)---an approach that has already proven to be highly efficient in a number of challenging multiscale problems in science and technology (KARDOS code library). With this method, the evolution of a complete heartbeat, from the excitation to the recovery phase, is simulated both in the frame of the anisotropic monodomain models and in the more realistic anisotropic bidomain models, coupled with either a variant of the simple FitzHugh--Nagumo model or the more complex phase-I Luo--Rudy ionic model. The numerical results exhibit a rather satisfactory performance of our adaptive method for complex cardiac reaction-diffusion models on 3D domains up to moderate sizes. In particular, the method accurately resolves the evolution of the intra- and extracellular potentials, gating variables, and ion concentrations during the excitation, plateau, and recovery phases.",

        "abstract":"Radio-frequency (RF) tomographic tracking is an emerging technology which tracks moving targets by analyzing changes of received signal strength (RSS) in wireless links. This paper presents and evaluates a novel RF tomographic tracking system that is capable of tracking a time-varying number of targets in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The system incorporates two major contributions: a RSS histogram based observation model and a multi-target filtering algorithm based on multi-Bernoulli approximation. In addition, the sequential Monte Carlo method is applied to implement the multi-target filter. To evaluate the tracking system, an experiment involving 3 targets is performed within an indoor area of 50 square meters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tracking system achieves high performance in accuracy and efficiency. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract":"Conventional decision forest based methods for image labelling tasks like object segmentation make predictions for each variable (pixel) independently [3, 5, 8]. This prevents them from enforcing dependencies between variables and translates into locally inconsistent pixel labellings. Random field models, instead, encourage spatial consistency of labels at increased computational expense. This paper presents a new and efficient forest based model that achieves spatially consistent semantic image segmentation by encoding variable dependencies directly in the feature space the forests operate on. Such correlations are captured via new long-range, soft connectivity features, computed via generalized geodesic distance transforms. Our model can be thought of as a generalization of the successful Semantic Texton Forest, Auto-Context, and Entangled Forest models. A second contribution is to show the connection between the typical Conditional Random Field (CRF) energy and the forest training objective. This analysis yields a new objective for training decision forests that encourages more accurate structured prediction. Our GeoF model is validated quantitatively on the task of semantic image segmentation, on four challenging and very diverse image datasets. GeoF outperforms both state of-the-art forest models and the conventional pair wise CRF.",

        "abstract":"This paper reports the development and experimental evaluation of a novel navigation system for underwater vehicles that employs Doppler sonar, synchronous clocks, and acoustic modems to achieve simultaneous acoustic communication and navigation. The system reported herein, which is employed to renavigate the vehicle in post-processing, forms the basis for a vehicle-based real-time navigation system. Existing high-precision absolute navigation techniques for underwater vehicles are impractical over long length scales and lack scalability for simultaneously navigating multiple vehicles. The navigation method reported in this paper relies on a single moving reference beacon, eliminating the requirement for the underwater vehicle to remain in a bounded navigable area. The use of underwater modems and synchronous clocks enables range measurements based on one-way time-of-flight information from acoustic data packet broadcasts. The acoustic data packets are broadcast from the single, moving reference beacon and can be received simultaneously by multiple vehicles within acoustic range. We report experimental results from the first deep-water evaluation of this method using data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) survey carried out in 4000 m of water on the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We report a comparative experimental evaluation of the navigation fixes provided by the proposed synchronous acoustic navigation system in comparison to navigation fixes obtained by an independent conventional long baseline acoustic navigation system.",

        "abstract":"<P>Computational experience is reported for various serial implementations of successive overrelaxation (SOR) applied to a linear multicommodity spatial price equilibrium problem posed as linear complementarity problem. Computational schemes that neglect the vast majority of the variables during most iterations are shown to be relatively efficient. A parallel implementation based on the same neglect is shown to exhibit encouraging average speedup over the single processor case. The SOR approach is shown empirically to converge for nonsymmetric problems. Dense network problems with up to 60 regions (each a potential supply or demand region) and 10 commodities, representing on the order of 36,000 variables, as well as sparse network problems with up to 140 regions, are typically solved in a few seconds of CPU time.<\/P>",

        "abstract":"This contribution deepens the feasibility issues of building state-of-the-art patent indicators with historical patent documents\n available in electronic form from the German Patent Office since the introduction of the Patent Law for the German Empire\n in 1877. The paper is divided into two parts: a methodological discussion and a case study on the chemical sector in Germany.\n The development of the technology sector defined matches remarkably well with stylised facts that institutional analysis in\n the chemical sector have provided us with so far. Moreover, the possibility of varying the level of aggregation in the analysis\n of technological areas discloses empirical evidence for the path-dependent development in the chemical sector after the advent\n of the organic chemistry and its application in the chemical synthesis of dye stuffs. Our findings enhance institutional and\n historical contributions about technological change in the chemical sector and suggest new research questions for innovation\n studies.",

        "abstract":"An increasing part of our daily personal communication takes place in various noisy environments. Ever since the broad introduction of cellular phones, we tend to communicate using these phones in cars, streets and other noisy places. Noise has a negative effect on both speech intelligibility and quality; a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may indeed result in a complete lack of speech intelligibility. This paper presents a speech enhancement method for personal communication, where the input signal is divided into a number of subbands that are individually and adaptively weighted in time domain according to a short term SNR estimate in each subband at every time instant. Hence the name adaptive gain equalizer. The signal disassembly into narrow subbands is performed using computationally effective infinite impulse response filters with low group delay. The method is focused on speech enhancement, acting as a speech booster, and remains idle when the SNR in a particular subband is low. Hence, background artifacts are eliminated. In addition, the method has proven to be advantageous since it offers low complexity and low delay. It is stand-alone and works regardless of speech coding schemes and other surrounding adaptive systems.",

        "abstract":"The weighted spanning tree contraint is defined from a set of variables X and a value K. The variables X represent the nodes of a graph and the domain of a variable x \u2208 X the neighbors of the node in the graph. In addition each pair (variable, value) is associated with a cost. This constraint states that the graph defined from the variables and the domains of the variables admits a spanning tree whose cost is less than K. Efficient algorithms to compute a minimum spanning tree or to establish arc consistency of this constraint have been proposed. However, these algorithms are based on complex procedures that are rather difficult to understand and to implement. In this paper, we propose and detail simpler algorithms for checking the consistency of the constraint and for establishing arc consistency. In addition, we propose for the first time incremental algorithms for this constraint, that is algorithms that have been designed in order to be efficiently maintained during the search for solution.",

Such platforms, including Arduino and Microsoft .NET Gadgeteer, lower the barrier to entry for building custom electronic devices and facilitate plug-and-play prototyping. They also bring sophisticated software tools and abstractions to the embedded arena, letting users quickly and easily create devices with complex behaviors. Combined with recent advances in rapid-physical-prototyping technologies, it's now possible to control the form factor of these prototypes and create devices with form and function approaching consumer expectations for electronics devices.Arduino, .NET Gadgeteer, prototyping, ubicomp devices, pervasive computing, digital camera prototype",

For regular bipartite graphs with n nodes on each side, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of a set R with |R|=n+1 such that perfect matchings with k red edges exist for all k,0\u2264k\u2264n. Given two integers pq we also determine the minimum cardinality of a set R of red edges such that there are perfect matchings with p red edges and with q red edges. For 3-regular bipartite graphs, we show that if p\u22644 there is a set R with |R|=p for which perfect matchings Mk exist with |Mk\u2229R|\u2264k for all k\u2264p. For trees we design a linear time algorithm to determine a minimum set R of red edges such that there exist maximum matchings with k red edges for the largest possible number of values of k.",

        "abstract":"Groups collaborating in online spaces on complex, extended projects develop behavioral conventions and agreed-upon practices to structure and regulate their interactions and work. Collaborators on Wikipedia have developed a multi-tiered policy environment to document a set of evolving principles, processes, and rules to facilitate productive group collaboration. Previous quantitative studies have noted this hierarchical structure, but have evaluated the policy environment as a singular entity rather than investigating potential differences between the three main regulatory genres that enable it. These studies also excluded essays, the least official regulatory genre, from their analyses. We perform a comparative content analysis of all three genres (policies, guidelines, and essays) and demonstrate that they focus on different areas of community regulation. Drawing on the theory of genre ecologies we discuss the possible role of unofficial genres such as essays in articulating and regulating work practices in online, organized collaborative work.",

        "abstract":"In this study, the authors present a floating-point synthetic aperture radar processor that achieves a power efficiency of 18.0 mW\/GFlop in simulation through the use of three-dimensional (3D) integration and reconfiguration of the data path. The reconfiguration reduces the number of arithmetic units required in every processing element (PE) from 24 down to 10. The processor uses a 3D integrated memory that reduces the memory power consumption by 70 when compared to a 2D memory. The system processes a SAR image using a two-tier 3D integrated PE, which when compared to an equivalent 2D PE decreases the power consumed in the interconnect of each PE by 15.5 and the footprint by 49.2 , and allows the PE to operate 7.1 faster in simulation. Additionally, by using 3D integration in the memory one can reduce the power consumption of the memory by 70 . Furthermore, the authors show how the 3D aspects of the processor can be realised by using 2D tools, when used in conjunction with the proposed through-silicon via assignment algorithm.",

Hardware emulation through reconfigurable systems (RS) built using FPGA's offer an cheap and efficient method to achieve the required speed-up. Emulation through RS poses some unique problems because of the limited circuit and I\/O resources. A preparatory step for emulation using RS is to partition the circuit into as few parts as possible satisfying the resource constraints. This paper presents multi-objective search based optimal and approximate algorithms for circuit partitioning for this purpose.",

The queue state information (QSI), channel state information (CSI), QoS requirements and transmitted packets are synthetically considered in the utility function, thus it can meet the needs of networks with multi-service better. Based on the proposed utility function, the problem is designed as the sum utility maximization subject to both base station (BS) power and each subcarrier power. A heuristic algorithm based on Lagrange Multipliers method is used to solve the formulated optimization problem. Numeric simulation results show that compared with traditional approaches which do not take the QSI and transmitted packets into account, our proposed approach achieves better performance in terms of balancing throughput, delay and fairness. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.",

        "abstract":"The dynamic-sized tabulation method can be used to eliminate redundant calls for certain classes of recursive programs. An innovative aspect of the method is the use of lambda abstractions that may subsequently be converted to bounded vectors, in order to share redundant calls via vector lookup.To facilitate this conversion to vector form, we propose a new inference method to conservatively determine the bounds for arithmetic parameters of recursive functions. Suitable techniques for inferring the safe bounds of these parameters are introduced, together with supporting transformations. The resulting method can obtain efficient vector-based programs without the need for run-time bounds checking.",

        "abstract":"Virtual Reality (VR) could be interesting tool to combat obesity and sedentariness in children. Objective is to study possibilities of VR during aerobic exercise in children obese and normal weight . Physiological (cardiovascular and metabolic response with biomedical sensors (smart fabrics TIAS)) and psychological responses have been collected. First study (n=90), a commercial platform was tested as support to aerobic exercise in a treadmill. Results showed more physiological effort by obese group and limitations to measure effort perception with Borg scale especially in obese group. In second study (n=126) a new VR platform was developed (VREP) and tested ,all the boys completed both conditions (same Aerobic exercise with\/without support VR). 59.5% felt more effort in the traditional condition The vast majority of the participants liked the idea of combining physical activity with VR as a form of treatment to increase physical activity.",

        "abstract":"\n The evolution of tonal-harmonic syntax in European notated music, from the beginnings of polyphony to the emergence of major-minor\n tonality, has been the subject of intense historical study. Several authors have also attempted statistical analyses of the\n frequency of occurrence of specific pitch-time patterns in specific periods or composers. But no-one has compared prevalence\n profiles across different periods. Here, we estimate the frequency of occurrence of pitch-class sets of cardinality three\n in small samples of vocal polyphony from the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. Throughout this period, sonorities that were later identified as major and minor became more prevalent (major\n more than minor). The rank order of sonorities was more variable in earlier music, where chords such as CDF or CE\n\n\n\n\n\n\\flat\\flatF were quite prominent; in later music, the third and fourth most common chords were suspended and diminished.\n \n ",

As our main result, we show that when \u2113 and n\/\u2113 are both large, the expected number of vertices that ever belong to an \u2113-component is about 121\/3 \u21131\/3 n2\/3. We also obtain limit theorems for the number of creations of \u2113-components.",

        "abstract":"The Black-Scholes model is the standard approach used for pricing financial options. However, although being theoretically strong, option prices valued by the model often differ from the prices observed in the financial markets. This paper applies a hybrid neural network which preprocesses financial input data for improving the estimation of option market prices. This model is comprised of two parts. The first part is a neural network developed to estimate volatility. The second part is an additional neural network developed to value the difference between the Black-Scholes model results and the actual market option prices. The resulting option price is then a summation between the Black-Scholes model and the network response. The hybrid system with a neural network for estimating volatility provides better performance in terms of pricing accuracy than either the Black-Scholes model with historical volatility, or the Black-Scholes model with volatility valued by the neural network.",

        "abstract":"Market-based conservation instruments, such as payments, auctions or tradable permits, are environmental policies that create financial incentives for landowners to engage in voluntary conservation on their land. But what if ecological processes operate across property boundaries and land use decisions on one property influence ecosystem functions on neighboring sites? This paper examines how to account for such spatial externalities when designing market-based conservation instruments. We use an agent-based model to analyze different spatial metrics and their implications on land use decisions in a dynamic cost environment. The model contains a number of alternative submodels which differ in incentive design and social interactions of agents, the latter including coordinating as well as cooperating behavior of agents. We find that incentive design and social interactions have a strong influence on the spatial allocation and the costs of the conservation market.",

        "abstract":"CORBA is the most widely used middleware for implementing distributed application. Currently, object implementations facilitate object group model to organize the object services. In addition to the complexity of designing the object groups, researchers also seek to improve the quality of service (QoS) by various means such as implementing load balancing to the system. This paper deals with the proposed load balancing service of distributed object groups. The proposed load balancing service uses the dynamic replication scheme which is mechanized by flow balance assumption (FBA) that derives from the arrival and service rate to execute request forwarding to new objects. The proposed on-demand replication scheme adjusts the number of replicated objects based on the arrival rate to minimize the waiting time of clients. It consists of procedures such as intercepting the request and executing on-demand activation of objects. The result of the simulation shows the improvement of the total mean client request completion time of the system as compared to other load balancing schemes.",

        "abstract":"Minutiae, which are the endpoints and bifurcations of fingerprint ridges, allow a very discriminative classification of fingerprints. However, a minutiae set is an unordered set and the minutiae locations suffer from various deformations such as translation, rotation and scaling. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to represent a minutiae set as a fixed-length feature vector, which is invariant to translation, and in which rotation and scaling become translations, so that they can be easily compensated for. By applying the spectral minutiae representation, we can combine the fingerprint recognition system with a template protection scheme, which requires a fixed-length feature vector. This paper also presents two spectral minutiae matching algorithms and shows experimental results.",

        "abstract":"An RF-DC converter enhanced by a DC-DC voltage booster in silicon-on-insulator technology for UHF radio frequency identification (RFID) energy harvesting is presented in this letter. When the received RF power level is -14 dBm or higher, the system, fabricated on an FR4 substrate using off-the-shelf low-cost discrete components and connected to a flexible dipole antenna, is able to produce 2.4 V DC voltage to power general-purpose electronic devices. As a simple proof of concept, a device comprising microcontroller, temperature sensor, and EEPROM is considered in this work. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of the system to autonomously perform temperature data logging up to a distance of 5 m from a conventional UHF RFID reader used as an RF energy source.",

        "abstract":"The blind placement of an epidural needle is among the most difficult regional anesthetic techniques. The challenge is to insert the needle in the mid-sagittal plane and to avoid overshooting the needle into the spinal cord. Prepuncture 2D ultrasound scanning has been introduced as a reliable tool to localize the target and facilitate epidural needle placement. Ideally, real-time ultrasound should be used during needle insertion. However, several issues inhibit the use of standard 2D ultrasound, including the obstruction of the puncture site by the ultrasound probe, low visibility of the target in ultrasound images, and increased pain due to longer needle trajectory. An alternative is to use 3D ultrasound imaging, where the needle and target could be visible within the same reslice of a 3D volume; however, novice ultrasound users (i.e., many anesthesiologists) still have difficulty interpreting ultrasound images of the spine and identifying the target epidural space. In this paper, we propose to augment 3D ultrasound images by registering a multi-vertebrae statistical shape+pose model. We use such augmentation for enhanced interpretation of the ultrasound and identification of the mid-sagittal plane for the needle insertion. Validation is performed on synthetic data derived from the CT images, and 64 in vivo ultrasound volumes.",

        "abstract":"A blind carrier phase derotator can be employed to correct and track carrier phase offset either before or after equalization in a blind adaptive receiver. This work proposes a computationally efficient blind carrier offset recovery algorithm for 8-vestigial side-band (8-VSB) signals by designing its cost function such that its cost surface has only two global minima without any undesirable local minima. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is not complicated by the possibility of a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm converging to a false local minimum, and global convergence can always be ensured. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can adopt a large step size in the transient period to accelerate the convergence speed along with a small step size in the convergence period to reduce the stochastic gradient noise.",

However, we believe that software repository mining can also provide valuable results for analyzing the system evolution at the architectural level.There are two challenges for analyzing the architecture evolution. The first one is to have in place a process for recovering the architectural models of the various releases. Architecture evolution is often visible only in the evolution of the implementation and this complicates the monitoring process. The second one is to have access to the past design models that were created by the architects during the design phase. A practical solutions for versioning the architectural models is not in use yet and this complicates the possibility of accessing the past design decisions.Analyzing architecture evolution through software repository mining represents the most promising choice. In order to conduct the analysis through software repository mining, we introduce our meta-model covering the design and implementation spaces. Then, we define a set of scenarios that demonstrate the architecturally significant analysis that we can conduct by mining the software repository.",

        "abstract":"A critical aspect of digital electronics is the testing of the manufactured designs for correct functionality. The testing process consists of first generating a set of test vectors, then applying them as stimuli to the manufactured designs, and finally comparing the output response with that of the desired response. A design is considered acceptable when the output response matches the desired response and is rejected otherwise. Fundamental to the process of test vector generation is the assumption of an underlying fault model that is a model of the failures introduced during manufacture. The choice of the fault model influences the accuracy of testing and the computer CPU time required to generate test vectors for a given design. The most popular fault model in the industry today is the single stuck-at fault at the gate level that requires exorbitantly large CPU times for moderately complex digital designs. This article introduces new high-level behavior fault models that are associated with high-level hardware descriptions of digital designs. The derivation of these faults is based on the failure modes of the language constructs of the high-level hardware description language. Behavior faults include multiple input stuck-at faults and this article also reasons the nature of test vectors for such faults. The potential advantages of behavior fault modeling include early estimates of fault coverage in the design process prior to the synthesis of the gate-level representation of the design, faster fault simulation, and results that may be more comprehensible to the high-level architects. The behavior-fault-modeling approach is evaluated through a study of correlation of the results of behavior fault simulation of several representative digital designs with the results of gate-level single stuck-at fault simulation of equivalent gate-level representations.",

        "abstract":"We study Facebook networks at 40 American universities, with focus on the comparison of their degree distributions and mechanism governing their evolution. We find that the heterogeneity indexes of these networks are all small compared with scale-free networks, and different from real-world social networks 5 Facebook networks show significant degree disassortativity; the exponent gamma for the power-law model of the degree distributions is large for the networks, indicating obvious homogeneity of network structure. We calculate the goodness-of-fit between the data and power law and find that the p-values are larger than threshold 0.1 for 20 networks, implying that power law is a plausible hypothesis; we compare the power-law model with 4 alternative competing distributions and find that power-law model gives the best fit for all 40 networks. However in wider interval of degrees some other distributions, such as log-normal or stretched exponential, can give the best fit. Further based on the homogeneity of Facebook we propose an analyzable model that integrates the introduction of new vertices and edges. The edges can be established either between new vertices and old vertices or between old vertices. The model captures the real evolution processes of Facebook networks and can well reproduce their degree distributions.",

The middleware is an extension to the Chedar peer-to-peer network allowing mobile devices to access the Chedar network and also to communicate with other Mobile Chedar peers. Currently, Mobile Chedar uses Bluetooth to connect to Chedar gateway peers, because Bluetooth is now the most widespread short-range radio technology in mobile phones. We also introduce in this paper one example of a Mobile Peer-to-Peer application for cooperative lecture notes taking, which is based on Mobile Chedar.",

        "abstract":"Binary de Bruijn sequences of period 2n bits have the property that all 2n distinct n-tuples occur once per period. To generate such a sequence with an n-stage shift-register requires the use of nonlinear feedback. These properties suggest that de Bruijn sequences may be useful in stream ciphers. However, any binary sequence can be generated using a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) of sufficient length. Thus, the linear complexity of a sequence, defined as the length of the shortest LFSR which generates it, is often used as a measure of the unpredictability of the sequence. This is a useful measure, since a well-known algorithm[1] can be used to successfully predict all bits of any sequence with linear complexity C from a knowledge of 2C bits. As an example, an m-sequence of period 2n -1 has linear complexity C=n, which clearly indicates that m-sequences are highly predictable.Now, the widely used definition of linear complexity stated above is open to different interpretations. We distinguish here between the periodic linear complexity (PLC) the length of the shortest LFSR which generates the given sequence and then repeats it cyclically - and the aperiodic linear complexity (ALC) - the length of the shortest LFSR which generates the given sequence followed by any arbitrary sequence of bits. This distinction is not made in the literature on de Bruijn sequences, but it has important practical consequences. In a stream cipher, it is clearly undesirable for keystream sequences to be allowed to repeat. Consequently, no more than P bits (where P is the sequence period) will ever be used, which implies that it is the ALC, not the PLC, which is of red concern. Unfortunately, all of the published results on the linear compiexity of de Bruijn sequences (e.g [2] and [3]) relate only to the PLC not the ALC. The research described here goes some way towards addressing this imbalance.",

        "abstract":"Motivation: The identification of short insertions and deletions (indels) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from Ion Torrent and 454 reads is a challenging problem, essentially because these techniques are prone to sequence erroneously at homopolymers and can, therefore, raise indels in reads. Most of the existing mapping programs do not model homopolymer errors when aligning reads against the reference. The resulting alignments will then contain various kinds of mismatches and indels that confound the accurate determination of variant loci and alleles. Results: To address these challenges, we realign reads against the reference using our previously proposed hidden Markov model that models homopolymer errors and then merges these pairwise alignments into a weighted alignment graph. Based on our weighted alignment graph and hidden Markov model, we develop a method called PyroHMMvar, which can simultaneously detect short indels and SNPs, as demonstrated in human resequencing data. Specifically, by applying our methods to simulated diploid datasets, we demonstrate that PyroHMMvar produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods, such as Samtools and GATK, and is less sensitive to mapping parameter settings than the other methods. We also apply PyroHMMvar to analyze one human whole genome resequencing dataset, and the results confirm that PyroHMMvar predicts SNPs and indels accurately.",

        "abstract":"This paper studies loop-delay compensation as a means to improve the robustness of timing recovery loops in tape storage systems. The delay compensation scheme is derived under fairly general assumptions and is found to match a known Kalman-filtering-based solution if a random-walk model of frequency-offset evolution is assumed. Extensions of the scheme to achieve delay compensation in multichannel tape-drive systems that employ global timing control are presented. The practical effectiveness of delay compensation is demonstrated using actual readback waveforms captured on commercial tape drives.",

        "abstract":"The process of annotating text corpora involves establishing annotation schemata which define the scope and depth of an annotation task at hand. We demonstrate this activity in Argo, a Web-based workbench for the analysis of textual resources, which facilitates both automatic and manual annotation. Annotation tasks in the workbench are defined by building workflows consisting of a selection of available elementary analytics developed in compliance with the Unstructured Information Management Architecture specification. The architecture accommodates complex annotation types that may define primitive as well as referential attributes. Argo aids the development of custom annotation schemata and supports their interoperability by featuring a schema editor and specialised analytics for schemata alignment. The schema editor is a self-contained graphical user interface for defining annotation types. Multiple heterogeneous schemata can be aligned by including one of two type mapping analytics currently offered in Argo. One is based on a simple mapping syntax and, although limited in functionality, covers most common use cases. The other utilises a well established graph query language, SPARQL, and is superior to other state-of-the-art solutions in terms of expressiveness. We argue that the customisation of annotation schemata does not need to compromise their interoperability.",

        "abstract":"I present a neural network model of the complex interactions between filial imprinting and a naive preference for heads and necks in domestic chicks. The fixed weights in the network were evolved in a genetic algorithm simulation which emphasized the survival value of both innate and learned information: having the networks recognize their \u201cmothers\u201d. The architecture and genetic algorithm regimen were able to produce five different behaviors exhibited by chicks in laboratory experiment emulations dissimilar to the training regimen used in the genetic algorithm simulations. These networks learn about their own biases, given random inputs, as well as learning about their environments through simulated visual inputs, and these kinds of learning interact to produce the behaviors seen in chicks. Thus, this architecture, in the context of selection for an ability to distinguish something that might be a mother from other objects in the environment, is a candidate architecture for the neural system underlying the full range of imprinting-related behaviors in chicks.",

        "abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of computing visual hulls from image contours. We propose a new hybrid approach which overcomes the precision-complexity trade-off inherent to voxel based approaches by taking advantage of surface based approaches. To this aim, we introduce a space discretization which does not rely on a regular grid, where most cells are ineffective, but rather on an irregular grid where sample points lie on the surface of the visual hull. Such a grid is composed of tetrahedral cells obtained by applying a Delaunay triangulation on the sample points. These cells are carved afterward according to image silhouette information. The proposed approach keeps the robustness of volumetric approaches while drastically improving their precision and reducing their time and space complexities. It thus allows modeling of objects with complex geometry, and it also makes real time feasible for precise models. Preliminary results with synthetic and real data are presented.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, a systematic approach and their corresponding metrics for concurrent anti-jamming (AJ) and low probability of detection (LPD) performance evaluations of a secure communications system are investigated. In general, it is necessary to deal simultaneously with adversary threats of both active jamming and passive detection for a secure communications system concern. For independent or concurrent AJ and LPD performance evaluations, a single varying paired and multiple paired fixed collocated jammers\/interceptors scenario is explored with real sinc type (sin(x)\/x) antenna patterns being considered for the communicators. The error probability with both AJ and LPD being considered simultaneously can be derived as system- and geometry-dependent factors and categorized as system metrics related to jammers, interceptors, and communicators themselves only. Whenever multiple collocated jammers\/interceptors are considered, we can observe interesting \"smoothed\" effects for bit energy to jamming density ratio (E b \/J o ), when one of these varying jammers\/interceptors is approaching or receding. In addition, by means of these system metrics, it is intuitive and straightforward to enhance system performance for the victim or to deteriorate system performance for the adversary, respectively. Moreover, the proposed approach and metrics have also paved one practical way for the developments of the latest emphasized cognitive radio (CR) communications systems, if all the collocated jammers\/interceptors on the proposed scenario are replaced with \"cooperative\" communicators.",

        "abstract":"In the medical community, the demand for detecting texture abnormalities related to pathological Protein Conformation Diseases (PCD) has been increasing for years. In this paper, we use the value (V) channel of an HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) image, which provides a measurable Detection Region of the V Channel (DRVC) for isolating muscular Intranuclear Inclusions (INIs) indicative of Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD), one variety of PCD. Derived from the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) computation over DRVC (CDF-DRVC), the robust cumulative histogram presents the INIs-texture-carrying intensity data as non-decreasing distributions, leading to an accurate estimation of intensities in the texture feature extraction. Beyond the proposed CDF-DRVC methodology, we introduce a methodology of feature synthesis to enhance the quality of feature representations. The experiments are conducted on irregular microscopic images (where variations in size and shape occur) in the binary classes of healthy and sick cases related to OPMD. The proposed framework achieves a higher accuracy rate for the detection as compared to other methods, and exhibits a detection strategy for other types of PCD in medical applications.",

In this way a single off the shelf PC can be used to build and test the software and in addition to that create deployable packages for multiple target platforms. Hence, the main contribution is an architectural concept for automated cross platform builds and testing based on virtualization of the processes that are platform dependent. The system was introduced for a large academic software library project in the field of robotics and machine vision. Here it is now productive and provides continuous feedback for developers, as well as includes the possibility to obtain the latest binary releases for end users.",

        "abstract":"Recently, many applications for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have been developed for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.",

        "abstract":"Nash equilibrium is one of the main concepts in the game theory. Recently it was shown, that problem of finding Nash equilibrium and an approximate Nash equilibrium is PPAD-complete. In this article we adapt Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) to the above problem. It may be classified as continuous problem, where two probability distributions over the set of pure strategies of both players should be found. Every deviation from the global optimum is interpreted as Nash approximation and called \u03b5-Nash equilibrium. We show, that the Differential Evolution approach can be determined as iterative method, which in successive iterations is capable to obtain \u03b5 value close to the global optimum. The contribution of this paper is the experimental analysis of the proposed approach and indication of it's strong features. We try to demonstrate, that the proposed method is very good alternative for the existing mathematical analysis of the mentioned Nash equilibrium problem.",

        "abstract":"This paper discusses methods for assigning codewords for the purpose of fingerprinting digital data (e.g., software, documents, and images). Fingerprinting consists of uniquely marking and registering each copy of the data. This marking allows a distributor to detect any unauthorized copy and trace it back to the user. This threat of detection will deter users from releasing unauthorized copies.A problem arises when users collude: For digital data, two different fingerprinted objects can be compared and the differences between them detected. Hence, a set of users can collude to detect the location of the fingerprint. They can then alter the fingerprint to mask their identities. We present a general fingerprinting solution which is secure in the context of collusion. In addition, we discuss methods for distributing fingerprinted data.",

        "abstract":"User-designer relations concerns the sorts of working relationships that arise between developers and end users of IT products - the different ways designers of IT products seek to engage with users, and the ways users seek to influence product design. It is through the shifting patterns of these relations that IT products are realised. Although it has generally been accepted that achieving better user-designer relations will improve the quality of IT products, there has been little consensus on how this might be achieved. This book aims to deepen our understanding of the relationships between users and designers both as they emerge in the wild and as a consequence of our attempts to intervene. Through a series of case studies the book juxtaposes in-depth explorations of different perspectives and approaches to thinking about - and doing - user-designer relations, considering important implications for design and computer science more generally. With contributions from leading authors and new voices in the field of user-designer relations, the text will be of interest to students and practitioners in information systems development. It will also be of interest to educators in the fields of information systems, design studies, and computer science.",

        "abstract":"It is important for improving the performance of automatic fingerprint identification system to estimate the ridge distance accurately. The traditional Fourier transform spectral analysis method had the worse redundancy degree in estimating the ridge distance because it was based on the two-dimension discrete Fourier spectrum. The statistical window method cannot obtain the accurate ridge distance because of the noises and the warp of the statistical value. The paper introduces the sampling theorem and artificial immune network into the fingerprint image ridge distance estimation method, transforms the discrete spectrum into the continuous spectrum, acquires the local peak points adopting the artificial immune network optimization algorithm and then obtains the ridge distance in the frequency field. The experimental results indicate that the ridge distance is more accurate and has improved the accuracy rate of automatic fingerprint identification system to a certain extent.",

        "abstract":"We have developed log-based recovery for middleware servers that access back-end transaction systems (DBMSs). Transactional consistency is provided between in-memory state stored in middleware servers and persistent state stored in transaction systems. A new logging method called results logging is exploited to ensure coordinated recovery of in-memory state with persistent database state. Results logging incurs low logging overhead for middleware servers and requires little or no modification to existing transaction systems. This makes our approach a practical coordinated recovery technique.",

Our hand-held wand can be used to (1) record sound, then (2) brush, scrape, strike or otherwise physically manipulate this sound against physical objects. These actions produce sound in a manner that leverages peoples existing intuitions about sonic properties of physical materials. The Sound of Touch permits real-time exploitation of the sonic properties of a physical environment, to achieve a rich and expressive control of digital sound that is not typically possible in electronic sound synthesis and control systems.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents a neural network (NN) based multimodal fusion classifier for automatic emotion recognition. The audio and visual channels provide complementary information, so we utilize features from three behavioral cues: frontal-view facial expression, profile-view facial expression and vocalization (audio). The problem of interest is to recognize basic emotions, and we use dimensional representation of emotion as the heuristic information (hints) when training NNs used for both single cue processing and multimodal fusion. With the aid of hints, the weights of NNs could learn optimized feature groupings and recognition accuracy of our classifier would be notably improved even when training data is insufficient. Experimental results on audio-visual emotion data recorded by ourselves in Wizard of Oz scenarios and emotion data from the Semaine naturalistic database both demonstrate that our approach is effective and promising.",

Short common beacon with low-rate omni-directional transmission and individual beacon with high-rate directional transmission are combined to carry all required information in the conventional beacon. A short common beacon may only include part of the physical layer preamble, or preamble with physical layer header or plus MAC header to reduce the beacon transmission time. Numerical analysis verified that the proposed beacon scheme can improve MAC efficiency significantly.",

        "abstract":"This paper proposes a new method for realizing the web page recommendation system by sharing users' web browse history on an anonymous P2P network. Our scheme creates a user profile, a summary of the user's web browse trends, by analyzing the contents of the web pages browsed. The scheme then provides a P2P network to exchange web browse histories so as to create mutual web page recommendations. The novelty of our method lies in its P2P network formulation; it is formulated in a way so that users having similar user profiles are automatically connected, yet their user profiles are protected from being disclosed to other users. The proposed method intentionally distributes bogus user profiles on the P2P network, while not harming the efficiency of the web browse history sharing process.",

        "abstract":"Accurately detecting pedestrians in images plays a critically important role\nin many computer vision applications. Extraction of effective features is the\nkey to this task. Promising features should be discriminative, robust to\nvarious variations and easy to compute. In this work, we present novel\nfeatures, termed dense center-symmetric local binary patterns (CS-LBP) and\npyramid center-symmetric local binary\/ternary patterns (CS-LBP\/LTP), for\npedestrian detection. The standard LBP proposed by Ojala et al. \\cite{c4}\nmainly captures the texture information. The proposed CS-LBP feature, in\ncontrast, captures the gradient information and some texture information.\nMoreover, the proposed dense CS-LBP and the pyramid CS-LBP\/LTP are easy to\nimplement and computationally efficient, which is desirable for real-time\napplications. Experiments on the INRIA pedestrian dataset show that the dense\nCS-LBP feature with linear supporct vector machines (SVMs) is comparable with\nthe histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature with linear SVMs, and the\npyramid CS-LBP\/LTP features outperform both HOG features with linear SVMs and\nthe start-of-the-art pyramid HOG (PHOG) feature with the histogram intersection\nkernel SVMs. We also demonstrate that the combination of our pyramid CS-LBP\nfeature and the PHOG feature could significantly improve the detection\nperformance-producing state-of-the-art accuracy on the INRIA pedestrian\ndataset.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we present MobiTrade, a utility driven trading system for efficient content dissemination on top of a disruption tolerant network. While simple tit-for-tat (TFT) mechanisms can force nodes to \"give one to get one\", dealing with the inherent tendency of peers to take much but give back little, they can quickly lead to deadlocks when some (or most) of interesting content must be somehow fetched across the network. To resolve this, MobiTrade proposes a trading mechanism that allows a node (\"merchant\") to buy, store, and carry content for other nodes (its \"clients\") so that it can later trade it for content it is personally interested in. To exploit this extra degree of freedom, MobiTrade nodes continuously profile the type of content requested and the collaboration level of encountered devices. An appropriate utility function is then used to collect an optimal inventory that maximizes the expected value of stored content for future encounters, matched to the observed mobility patterns, interest patterns, and collaboration levels of encountered nodes. Using NS3 simulations based on synthetic and real mobility traces, we show that MobiTrade achieves up to 2\u00d7 higher query success rates compared to other content dissemination schemes. Furthermore, we show that MobiTrade successfully isolates selfish devices.",

The correct solution can only be identified using a priori information. This work proposes a method to determine the number of possible solutions, which may be useful for the development of algorithms to solve this ambiguity problem. Our method proceeds by generating and counting all the possible solutions. Using real data, it was found that the number of solutions is moderate and an extensive search could be a feasible option at certain levels of the search process. The currently available computation power should be able to handle this solution space.",

        "abstract":"There are not very many existing logics of belief which have both a perspicuous semantics and are computationally attractive. An exception is the logic SL, proposed by Liu, Lakemeyer, and Levesque, which allows for a decidable and often even tractable form of reasoning. While the language is first-order and hence quite expressive, it still has a number of shortcomings. For one, beliefs about beliefs are not addressed at all. For another, the names of individuals are rigid, that is, their identity is assumed to be known. In this paper, we show how both shortcomings can be overcome by suitably extending the language and its semantics. Among other things, we show that determining the beliefs of a certain kind of fully introspective knowledge bases is decidable and that unknown individuals in the knowledge base can be accommodated in a decidable manner as well.",

Our approach generalizes a recent result of Braides, Solci and Vitali [2]. In particular, we study mass spring models with full nearest and next-to-nearest pair interactions. We also consider boundary value problems where a part of the boundary is free.",

        "abstract":"Personal health records (PHR) have enormous potential to improve both documentation of health information and patient care. The adoption of these systems, however, has been relatively slow. In this work, we used a multi-method approach to evaluate PHR systems. We interviewed potential end users---clinicians and patients---and conducted evaluations with patients and caregivers as well as a heuristic evaluation with HCI experts. In these studies, we focused on three PHR systems: Google Health, Microsoft HealthVault, and WorldMedCard. Our results demonstrate that both usability concerns and socio-cultural influences are barriers to PHR adoption and use. In this paper, we present those results as well as reflect on how both PHR designers and developers might address these issues now and throughout the design cycle.",

        "abstract":"More and more content in various formats becomes available via the World Wide Web (WWW). Currently available Web browsers are able to access and interpret these contents (i.e., Web videos, text, image, and audio). These contents stimulate only senses like audition or vision. Recently, it has been proposed to stimulate also other senses while consuming multimedia content, through so-called sensory effects. These sensory effects aim to enhance the ambient experience by providing effects such as light, wind, vibration, etc. The effects are represented as Sensory Effect Metadata (SEM) description which is associated to multimedia content and is rendered on devices like fans, vibration chairs, or lamps. In this paper we present two subjective quality assessments which comprise sensory effects, such as light, in the area of the WWW and their results achieved. The first assessment evaluates the influence of light effects on the Quality of Experience (QoE). The second assessment measures the impact of different settings for the color calculation on the viewing experience. Furthermore, we describe a Web browser plug-in for Mozilla Firefox which is able to render such sensory effects that are provided via the WWW.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, the adaptive neural attitude control is developed for near-space vehicles with the oblique wing (NSVOW) via using the sliding mode disturbance observer technique. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is employed to approximate the unknown system uncertainty. Then, the sliding mode disturbance observer is designed to estimate the unknown external disturbance and the unknown neural network approximation error. Using outputs of the sliding mode disturbance observer and the RBFNN, the adaptive neural attitude control is proposed for NSVOWs. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved using the Lyapunov analysis. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive neural attitude control scheme.",

However, as the pool of subjects increases, variation in surgical techniques and unanticipated motion increases the challenge of creating robust statistical models of gestures. This paper examines the applicability of advanced modeling techniques from automated speech recognition to the problem of increasing variability in surgical motions. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of automatically bootstrapped user-adaptive models on diverse data acquired from the da Vinci surgical robot.",

The splitting number sp(G) of C is the smallest integer sp(G) >= 0 such that a planar graph can be obtained from G by sp(G) vertex splitting operations. The vertex deletion vd(G) of G is the smallest integer vd(G) >= 0 such that a planar graph can be obtained from G by the removal of vd(G) vertices. Regular toroidal meshes are popular topologies for the connection networks of SIMD parallel machines. The best known of these meshes is the rectangular toroidal mesh C-m x C-n for which is known the skewness, the splitting number and the vertex deletion. In this work we consider two related families: a triangulation Tc-m x c(n) of C-m x C-n in the torus, and an hexagonal mesh Hc(m) x c(n), the dual of Tc-m x c(n) in the torus. It is established that sp(Tc-m x c(n)) = vd(Tc-m x c(n) = sk(Hc(m) x c(n)) = sp(Hc(m) x c(n)) = vd(Hc(m) x c(n)) = min{m, n} and that sk(Tc-m x c(n)) = 2 min {m, n}.",

        "abstract":"Traffic grooming in optical networks has gained significance due to the prevailing sub-wavelength requirement of end users. Optical networks get upgraded to the latest technology slowly with time with only a subset of nodes being upgraded to the latest technology. The networks are thus comprised of nodes employing heterogeneous switching architectures. In this paper, we develop a framework called Methodology for Information Collection and Routing in Optical Networks (MICRON) for connection establishment in optical grooming networks with heterogeneous switching architectures. We illustrate with examples the information that may be collected from the links, and operators that may be used to obtain information along a path. The information can be used to select a path dynamically depending on the network status. We complete the MICRON framework by providing a generic channel assignment procedure that could be employed to implement different channel assignment schemes. Various routing and channel assignment algorithms can be developed from the proposed framework. The framework may be easily implemented with simple traffic engineering extensions to the already existing routing protocols in the wide-area networks.",

        "abstract":"Four critical requirements are identified for the built-in self-testing of programmable logic arrays (BIST PLAs): the test set to test the PLA as well as the output response must be independent of the function of the PLA; the test pattern generator (TPG) and the response evaluator circuits must be simple to keep the extra logic overhead to a minimum; the fault coverage of the PLA must be within acceptable limits; and the speed of the test application must be high. A design that meets all of these goals is proposed. The approach is based on counting crosspoints, as opposed to the conventional parity technique. The TPG and RE circuits are simple and consist of shift registers and counters. The design requires a reorganization of the columns of the PLA on the basis of the number of crosspoints. This design provides extremely high fault coverage: the coverage for multiple faults is higher than that of any BIST design known to the authors, and the single-fault coverage is 100%. The design is simple and can easily be incorporated into existing computer-aided design systems",

Numerical calculation of impedance between the file (electrode) inserted in the root canal of the tooth and the outer electrode enables investigation of the impedance method used in dentistry for evaluation of the root canal length. Simulations confirm the improved sensitivity of the impedance method using the results of multiple frequency measurements.",

        "abstract":"We exhibit three approximation algorithms for the allocation problem in combinatorial auctions with complement free bidders. The running time of these algorithms is polynomial in the number of items $m$ and in the number of bidders n, even though the \"input size\" is exponential in m. The first algorithm provides an O(log m) approximation. The second algorithm provides an O(\u221a m) approximation in the weaker model of value oracles. This algorithm is also incentive compatible. The third algorithm provides an improved 2-approximation for the more restricted case of \"XOS bidders\", a class which strictly contains submodular bidders. We also prove lower bounds on the possible approximations achievable for these classes of bidders. These bounds are not tight and we leave the gaps as open problems.",

The platforms chosen for this study are a cluster of workstations (the LACE experimental testbed at NASA Lewis), a shared memory multiprocessor (the Cray YMP), distributed memory multiprocessors with different topologies \u9a74 the IBM SP and the Cray T3D. We investigate the impact of various networks, connecting the cluster of workstations, on the performance of the application and the overheads induced by popular message passing libraries used for parallelization. The work also highlights the importance of matching the memory bandwidth to the processor speed for good single processor performance. By studying the performance of an application on a variety of architectures, we are able to point out the strengths and weaknesses of each of the example computing platforms",

Combining the delivery of services for various users simultaneously requires the setting up of users profiles as a record of their needs, requirements and desires. We are thus interested in a assessment of the requirements and specifications of user profiling. Furthermore there is also a need for the merger of multiple user profiles. As we are involved in the development of a smart family home and a responsive Exhibition booth, we will investigate user profiling and profile management within these two contexts. We finally discuss some issues that we consider detrimental to the success of aware environments.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we examine a queueing problem motivated by the pipeline polling protocol in satellite communications. The model is an extension of the cyclic queueing system withM-limited service. In this service mechanism, each queue, after receiving service on cyclej, makes a reservation for its service requirement in cyclej + 1. The main contribution to queueing theory is that we propose an approximation for the queue length and sojourn-time distributions for this discipline. Most approximate studies on cyclic queues, which have been considered before, examine the means only. Our method is an iterative one, which we prove to be convergent by using stochastic dominance arguments. We examine the performance of our algorithm by comparing it to simulations and show that the results are very good.",

        "abstract":"Are the object manipulation techniques traditionally used in head-mounted displays (HMDs) applicable to augmented reality based projection systems? This paper examines the differences between HMD- and projector\/camera-based AR interfaces in the light of a manipulation task involving documents and applications projected on common office surfaces such as tables, walls, cabinets, and floor. We report a Wizard of Oz study where subjects were first asked to create gesture\/voice commands to move 2D objects on those surfaces and then exposed to gestures created by the authors. Among the options, subjects could select the object to be manipulated using voice command; touching, pointing, and grabbing gesture; or a virtual mouse. The results show a strong preference for a manipulation interface based on pointing gestures using small hand movements and involving minimal body movement. Direct touching of the object was also common when the object being manipulated was within the subjects' arm reach. Based on these results, we expect that the preferred interface resembles, in many ways, the egocentric model traditionally used in AR.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents an automatic scratch detection and removal approach for archive film sequences. The proposed detector mainly exploits temporal coherency of candidate scratch positions, which are obtained using an automatic scratch detection method proposed in the literature. In the restoration stage, both spatial and temporal information are employed. The proposed edge priority based scratch removal algorithm successfully removes scratch effects from archive film sequences.",

        "abstract":"Understanding source code is crucial for successful software maintenance. A particularly important activity to understand source code is navigating the call graph [4]. Programmers have developed distinct strategies for effective call graph exploration [3, 9]. We introduce Blaze, a source code exploration tool tailored closely to these strategies. In a study, we compare Blaze to Stacksplorer [2], a tool that visualizes the immediate neighborhood of the current method in the call graph, to a tool resembling the standard Call Hierarchy view in the Eclipse IDE, and to an unmodified Xcode installation. The call graph exploration tools significantly increased success rates in typical software maintenance tasks, and using Stacksplorer or Blaze significantly reduced task completion times compared to using the Call Hierarchy or Xcode.",

        "abstract":"We study the problem of answering queries over sources with limited access patterns. The problem is to decide whether a given query Q is feasible, i.e., equivalent to an executable query Q' that observes the limited access patterns given by the sources. We characterize the complexity of deciding feasibility for the classes CQ(-) (conjunctive queries with negation) and UCQ(-) (unions of CQ(-) queries): Testing feasibility is just as hard as testing containment and therefore Pi(2)(P)-complete. We also provide a uniform treatment for CQ UCQ, CQ(-), and UCQ(-) by devising a single algorithm which is optimal for each of these classes. In addition, we show how one can often avoid the worst-case complexity by certain approximations: At compile-time, even if a query Q is not feasible, we can find efficiently the minimal executable query containing Q. For query answering at runtime, we devise an algorithm which may report complete answers even in the case of infeasible plans and which can indicate to the user the degree of completeness for certain incomplete answers.",

        "abstract":"One key element in understanding the molecular machinery of the cell is to understand the structure and function of each protein encoded in the genome. A very successful means of inferring the structure or function of a previously unannotated protein is via sequence similarity with one or more proteins whose structure or function is already known. Toward this end, we propose a means of representing proteins using pairwise sequence similarity scores. This representation, combined with a discriminative classification algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM), provides a powerful means of detecting subtle structural and evolutionary relationships among proteins. The algorithm, called SVM-pairwise, when tested on its ability to recognize previously unseen families from the SCOP database, yields significantly better performance than SVM-Fisher, profile HMMs, and PSI-BLAST.",

        "abstract":"In the field of automation technology, research and development for industrial applications has increased rapidly in recent years. Therefore, industrial automation and control education is a very important element of the industrialization process in developing countries, such as Turkey, which needs to keep abreast for the latest developments in the field. However, there are several challenges in industrial automation education in a developing country. First, a course that includes instrumentation and automation needs a significant budget. Moreover, the necessary instrumentation is generally confusing to use, which reduces the motivation of the students. Another challenge is that real industrial processes cannot be set up in the laboratory because these may be hazardous for students. To overcome these challenges, this paper gives a detailed description of some laboratory experiments in virtual-instrument-aided supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. These experiments have been developed as part of implementing an inductive education strategy in the Automation Laboratory of Ege Vocational School, Ege University, I\u0307zmir, Turkey. The experiments described here are designed to show how an economically feasible SCADA system could be built. The advantages and the challenging points of these experiments are also discussed and evaluated. A quantitative evaluation was achieved using a one-way ANOVA test performed on the exam results of the students. The qualitative evaluation was performed using a survey given to the students. The results indicated that the performance of the students was improved compared to the previous years' students.",

        "abstract":"We present a technique to generate an illumination subspace for arbitrary 3D faces based on the statistics of measured illuminations under variable lighting conditions from many subjects. A bilinear model based on the higher-order singular value decomposition is used to create a compact illumination subspace given arbitrary shape parameters from a parametric 3D face model. Using a fitting procedure based on minimizing the distance of the input image to the dynamically changing illumination subspace, we reconstruct a shape-specific illumination subspace from a single photograph. We use the reconstructed illumination subspace in various face recognition experiments with variable lighting conditions and obtain accuracies which are very competitive with previous methods that require specific training sessions or multiple images of the subject.",

        "abstract":"Robust tracking of objects in video is a key challenge in computer vision with applications in automated surveillance, video indexing, human-computer-interaction, gesture recognition, traffic monitoring, etc. Many algorithms have been developed for tracking an object in controlled environments. However, they are susceptible to failure when the challenge is to track multiple objects that undergo appearance change to due to factors such as variation in illumination and object pose. In this paper we present a tracker based onBayesian estimation,which is relatively robust to object appearance change, and can trackmultiple targets simultaneously in real time. The object model for computing the likelihood function is incrementally updated and uses background-foreground segmentation information toameliorate the problemof drift associated with objectmodel update schemes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by tracking objects in image sequences from the CAVIAR dataset.",

        "abstract":"We consider ensemble classification when there is no common labeled data for designing the function which aggregates classifier decisions. In recent work, we dubbed this problem distributed ensemble classification, addressing when local classifiers are trained on different (e.g., proprietary, legacy) databases or operate on different sensing modalities. Typically, fixed (untrained) rules of classifier combination such as voting methods are used in this case. However, these may perform poorly, especially when (i) the local class priors, used in training, differ from the true (test batch) priors and (ii) classifier decisions are statistically dependent. Alternatively, we proposed several transductive methods, optimizing the combining rule for objective functions measured on the test batch. We proposed both maximum likelihood (ML) and constraint-based (CB) objectives and found that CB achieved superior performance. Here, we develop CB extensions (i) for sequential decisionmaking and (ii) exploiting additional class information contained in the local classifier feature vectors. The new sequential method is applied to biometric authentication. We demonstrate these new CB methods achieve better ensemble decision accuracy than methods which apply fixed rules in combining classifier decisions.",

        "abstract":"A neural network approach to the partial shape classification problem is derived. Although neural networks are generally robust static pattern classifiers, they are not effective in classifying patterns with inherent temporal variations. In order to compensate for temporal variations resulting from random partial occlusion, a multi-neural network system which includes a dynamic alignment procedure at the neural net outputs is proposed. In formulating the dynamic alignment stage, a similarity measure between an input and the neural net outputs is defined. Combining the robustness of neural networks with the non-linear alignment capability of dynamic alignment results in a classifier which can tolerate high degrees of random noise and random occlusion in shapes.",

        "abstract":"Service robots are quickly integrating into our society to help people, but how could robots help other robots? The main contribution of this work is a software module that allows a robot to transparently include behaviors that are performed by other robots into its own set of behaviors. The proposed solution addresses issues related to communication and opacity of behavior distribution among team members. This location transparency allows the execution of a behavior without knowing where is located. To apply our approach, a multi-robot distributed receptionist application was developed using robots that were not originally designed to cooperate among themselves.",

The individual MLCGs use short multipliers that are nearly optimal based on the spectral test. The shortness of the multipliers leads to fast and portable implementations. The combination method produces a generator whose period is the least common multiple of the individual periods. These generators can also be split into many \u201cindependent\u201d generators (i.e. that produce disjoint subsequences) and it is easy to skip a long subsequence of numbers without doing the work of generating them all.",

        "abstract":"A new multispectral image compression technique based on the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) and the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is proposed. The quadtree for determining the transform block size and the quantizer for encoding the transform coefficients are jointly optimized in a rate-distortion sense. The problem is solved by a Lagrange multiplier approach. After a quadtree is determined by this approach, a one-dimensional (1-D) KLT is applied to the spectral axis for each block before the DCT is applied on the spatial domain. The eigenvectors of the autocovariance matrix, the quantization scale, and the quantized transform coefficients for each block are the output of the encoder. The overhead information required in this scheme is the bits for the quadtree, KLT, and quantizer representation.",

        "abstract":"High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising technique for cancer treatment owing to its minimal invasiveness and safety. However, skin burn, long treatment time and incomplete ablation are main shortcomings of this method. This paper presents a novel HIFU robotic system for breast cancer treatment. The robot has 4 rotational degrees of freedom with the workspace located in a water tank for HIFU beam imaging and ablation treatment. The HIFU transducer combined with a diagnostic 2D linear ultrasound probe is mounted on the robot end- effector, which is rotated around the HIFU focus when ablating the tumor. HIFU beams are visualized by the 2D probe using beam imaging. Skin burn can be prevented or alleviated by avoiding long time insonification towards the same skin area. The time cost could be significantly reduced, as there is no need to interrupt the ablation procedure for cooling the skin. In addition, our proposed robot control strategies can avoid incomplete ablation. Experiments were carried out and the results showed the effectiveness of our proposed system.",

        "abstract":"Cooperative caching is a very important technique for efficient data dissemination and sharing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Many applications have requirements on the consistency of the content cached on different nodes. However, this issue has not been adequately addressed and few of the existing solutions are really adaptive in a dynamic MANET environment. In this paper, we propose a predictive algorithm called PCC (Predictive Caching Consistency) that can make on-line tradeoff between the level of consistency of cached data and the overhead associated with achieving it. Simulation results show that PCC works adaptively and efficiently in a MANET environment, even with dynamic changes in the size of the network, mobility model of nodes, number of queries, and frequency of data updates.",

        "abstract":"Recent experiments have shown that neocortical synapses exhibit both short-term plasticity and spike-timing dependent long-term plasticity. It has been suggested that changes in short-term plasticity are mediated by a redistribution of synaptic efficacy. Here we propose a simple model of the interaction between spike-timing dependent plasticity and short-term plasticity. We show that the model captures the synaptic behavior seen in experiments on redistribution of synaptic efficacy. Results from our simulations suggest that spike-timing dependent redistribution of synaptic efficacy offers neocortical neurons a potentially powerful mechanism for learning spatiotemporal patterns in the input stream.",

        "abstract":"A novel method is presented for compiling two-level rules which have multiple context parts. The same method can also be applied to the resolution of so-called right-arrow rule conflicts. The method makes use of the fact that one can efficiently compose sets of two-level rules with a lexicon transducer. By introducing variant characters and using simple pre-processing of multi-context rules, all rules can be reduced into single-context rules. After the modified rules have been combined with the lexicon transducer, the variant characters may be reverted back to the original surface characters. The proposed method appears to be efficient but only partial evidence is presented yet.",

For an interval T2 FS, the centroid can be computed by using two iterative procedures that were developed by Karnik and Mendel [2]. In this paper, we prove that if the footprint of uncertainty for an interval T2 FS is symmetrical about the primary variable y at y = m, then the centroid is also symmetrical about y = m and its defuzzified value equals m. As a consequence of this, computation of the centroid for such a T2 FS is reduced by 50%, and the importance of obtaining a non-symmetrical interval T2 FS prior to defuzzification is demonstrated.",

We compare this method experimentally with the state-of-the-art improved WS steganalysis. The results of our experiments show that depending on the archiver the new method can be more effective than improved WS steganalysis for noisy color images.",

This technique allows the adder to work at a lower supply voltage than that required by a conventional adder while maintaining the same throughput. The VL-adder design can be further modified to overcome the effects of negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) on circuit delay. By applying VL-adder concept to a 64-bit carry-select adder design, more than 40% energy saving is obtained when a similar throughput is maintained.",

        "abstract":"Several architectures have been recently proposed that store relational data in encrypted form on untrusted relational databases. Such architectures permit the creation of novel Internet services and also offer an opportunity for a better construction of ASP solutions. Environments where there are limited resources that do not permit an efficient management of databases or where it is critical to offer a robust Internet access to private data may all benefit from the above architectures. In this paper we analyze the impact that this architecture has on the typical services of a database. The analysis is based on the experience gained in the construction of a prototype of a complete architecture for the management of encrypted databases. Specifically, we illustrate the impact on query translation and optimization, and the main components of the software architecture of the prototype.",

        "abstract":"We consider the problem of scheduling jobs that require multiple resources such as memory, bandwidth and processors. For each job, the input specifies start time, finish time and profit; the input also specifies the job's requirement for each resource. Each resource has a fixed capacity (called bandwidth). A feasible solution is a subset of jobs such that for any timeslot and any resource, the total requirement of the jobs active at the timeslot does not exceed the capacity of the resource. The goal is to maximize the profit of the jobs selected. We present an approximation algorithm with provable guarantees and effective heuristics for this problem. The algorithm has an approximation ratio of O(r), where r is the number of resources. We present an experimental evaluation of our algorithms that exhibit their effectiveness.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the effects of using three different nursery sizing policies on overall and garbage collection performances. As part of our investigation, we modify the parallel generational collector in HotSpot to support a fixed ratio policy and heap availability policy (similar to that used in Appel collectors), in addition to its GC Ergonomics policy. We then compare the performances of 16 large and small multithreaded Java benchmarks; each is given a reasonably sized heap and utilizes all three policies. The result of our investigation indicates that many benchmarks are sensitive to heap sizing policies, resulting in overall performance differences that can range from 1 percent to 36 percents. We also find that in our server application benchmarks, more than one policy may be needed. As a preliminary study, we introduce a hybrid policy that uses one policy when the heap space is plentiful to yield optimal performance and then switches to a different policy to improve survivability and yield more graceful performance degradation under heavy memory pressure.",

        "abstract":"Importance weighted aggregation plays a central role in utilization of information resources for information retrieval and fusion, pattern and object recognition, decision making, etc. A class of aggregation operators of particular interest is formed by the aggregation operators between the min (minimum) and the max (maximum), the so-called averaging operators. Two key issues in the choice of such an operator for a given application are the kind of importance weighting and the andness (''minness'') of the operator. Two main kinds of importance weighting for such operators, namely multiplicative and implicative, are proposed and discussed. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate the choice and application of such operators through providing a systematization of their classes according to their behavior and equipping some classical averaging operators, namely the power means and the OWA operators, with importance weighting schemes and direct parametric andness control for both kinds of importance weighting. For increased efficacy and for symmetric behavior by andness and orness (=1-andness) at the same degree of both measures, the two classes of averaging operators are applied in a De Morgan dual form. The main issue in the choice of underlying the classical averaging operator appears to be the computational cost of its application.",

In this paper, we present a new automatic algo- rithm to measure Cobb angle by using nuclear medicine whole body bone scan images. Our algorithm design is based on the fuzzy sets histogram thresholding, anatomi- cal knowledge-based image segmentation method, and morphology technology. It is expected that the results may help physicians to diagnose scoliosis via the scintigraphy images, and thus to reduce radiation done to patients.",

Considering an early arrival system, as soon as the server empties the system in a regular busy period, he leaves the system and takes a working vacation for a random duration at time n. The service times both in a working vacation and in a busy period and the vacation times are assumed to be geometrically distributed. By using embedded Markov chain approach and difference operator method, queue length of the whole system at random slots and the waiting time for an arriving customer are obtained. The queue length distributions of the outside observer's observation epoch are investigated. Numerical experiment is performed to validate the analytical results.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we present a joint approach to data detection and channel estimation for the asynchronous direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems employing orthogonal signaling formats and long scrambling codes. Our emphasis is placed on different channel estimation algorithms since the performance of a communication system depends largely on its ability to retrieve an accurate measurement of the underlying channel. We investigate channel estimation algorithms under different conditions. The estimated channel information is used to enable coherent data detection to combat the detrimental effect of the multiuser interference and the multipath propagation of the transmitted signal. In the considered multiuser detector, we mainly use interference cancellation techniques, which are suitable for long-code CDMA systems. Interference cancellation and channel estimation using soft estimates of the transmitted signal is also proposed in this paper. Different channel estimation schemes are evaluated and compared in terms of mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation and bit error rate (BER) performance. Based on our analysis and numerical results, some recommendations are made on how to choose appropriate channel estimators in practical systems. Copyright (C) 2006 AEIT.",

It involves a time consuming and error prone process of alternating coagulation and cutting until the line of transaction is completed to finally divide the liver. We proposed a new robotic mechanism to automate the ablation and division process. The robotic device comprises a 2-link manipulator, an x-y translator, a flexi-arm as well as a liver ablation and division device. The process of precise linear motion ablation and cutting has been integrated with the guidance of a robotic mechanism to uniformly coagulate and slit areas of the parenchymal. A prototype of the robotic device has been evaluated on its ability to uniformly target a large region.",

        "abstract":"The Pima Indian diabetes (PID) dataset [1], originally donated by Vincent Sigillito from the Applied Physics Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University, is one of the most wellknown datasets for testing classification algorithms. This dataset consists of records describing 786 female patients of Pima Indian heritage which are at least 21 years old living near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The problem is to predict whether a new patient would test positive for diabetes. However, the correct classification percentage of current algorithms oil this dataset is oftentimes coincidental. The root to the above critical problem is the overfitting and overgeneralization behaviors of a given classification algorithm when it is processing a dataset. Although the above situation is of fundamental importance in data mining, it has not been studied from a comprehensive point of view. Thus, this paper describes a new approach, called the Homogeneity- Based Algorithm (or HBA) as developed by Pham and Triantaphyllou in [2-3], to optimally control the overfitting and overgeneralization behaviors of classification on this dataset. The HBA is used in conjunction with traditional classification approaches (such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), or Decision Trees (DTs)) to enhance their classification accuracy. Some computational results seem to indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms current approaches.",

        "abstract":"This paper evaluates acknowledgement schemes for random access based media access protocols for star-coupled WDM networks. Each node requires a fast wavelength tunable transmitter and a slow\/fixed receiver. The multiple, multi-access channels are pre-allocated to the nodes for data reception. Each data packet has to be acknowledged by the destination node to indicate successful transmission since the channel cannot be sensed. One solution to providing acknowledgements is to extend the transmission slot: each transmission consists of a data transmission phase and an acknowledgement phase. At the end of the slot, the source node would know if transmission was successful if collisionless acknowledgement transmission is ensured. However, this approach degrades with increased propagation delay and processing latency. An alternative technique eliminates the acknowledgement phase by requiring explicit acknowledgements from the destination node. The relative advantages and drawbacks of the two schemes are studied, and the impact of the acknowledgement scheme on protocol performance is examined. Protocol performance, measured in terms of average packet delay and network throughput, is studied with respect to system scalability, sensitivity to propagation delay, packet processing latency and transmitter tuning latency.",

        "abstract":"Integrating RFID data from various sources in a value chain is an important requirement for leveraging the full potential of the technology. To facilitate this crucial integration, the global standardization organization GS1 is currently developing a range of service specifications. Yet, the services specified so far do not enable event-based interaction schemes and do not leverage the detection of distributed complex events. In this paper we propose to fill this gap by means of a peer-to-peer based broker network that can realize event-based interaction on top of existing specifications. For this infrastructure we present a new method to improve in-network processing. As shown by our experiments, our method significantly reduces overall system load by exploiting a priori knowledge about the observed processes.",

It amounts here to obtain the convergence of the error covariance matrix of the BLMSF to a stationary value under the assumption of mean square stability of the MJLS and ergodicity of the associated Markov chain $\\theta _{t}$. It is shown that there exists a unique solution for the stationary Riccati filter equation, and this solution is the limit of the error covariance matrix of the BLMSF. The advantage of this scheme is that it is easy to implement since the filter gain can be performed offline, leading to a linear time-invariant filter.",

        "abstract":"Slight hardware and algorithm modifications as well as a higher power ratio of a three-phase pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) rectifier make compensation of neighboring nonlinear power load possible. The active filtering function enlarges the functionality of PWM rectifiers, which decreases the cost of additional installation of compensating equipment. It gives a chance to fulfill both shunt active filter (SAF) and PWM rectifier tasks in a multidrive system by one advanced converter. Thanks to the idea of virtual flux, the direct power control space-vector-modulated (DPC-SVM) and new synchronous double reference frame phase-locked loop approach, the control system is resistant to a majority of line voltage disturbances. This assures proper operation of the system for abnormal and failure grid conditions. Simulation and experimental results have proven excellent performance and verify the validity of the proposed system.",

        "abstract":"In many applications of lifetime data analysis, it is important to perform inferences about the mode of the hazard function in situations of lifetime data modeling with unimodal hazard functions. For lifetime distributions where the mode of the hazard function can be analytically calculated, its maximum likelihood estimator is easily obtained from the invariance properties of the maximum likelihood estimators. From the asymptotical normality of the maximum likelihood estimators, confidence intervals can be obtained. However, these results might not be very accurate for small sample sizes and\/or large proportion of censored observations. Considering the log-logistic distribution for the lifetime data with shape parameter \u03b2>1, we present and compare the accuracy of asymptotical confidence intervals with two confidence intervals based on bootstrap simulation. The alternative methodology of confidence intervals for the mode of the log-logistic hazard function are illustrated in three numerical examples.",

        "abstract":"Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAM) are widely used in processor design. Different cells have been proposed in the past to overcome concerns associated with low retention time, degradation in performance due to process variations and susceptibility to soft errors. This paper proposes two novel DRAM cells (referred to as 4TI and 4T1D) that utilize the techniques of gated diode and forward body-biasing to overcome the above issues. The designs of these cells are evaluated by HSPICE simulation; different figures of merits (such as Read delay, Write delay, retention time, power dissipation, critical charge and layout area) are assessed and a comparative analysis of the proposed cells with existing cells is pursued. The 4TI cell achieves the best power dissipation, while the 4T1D achieves the best retention time, the highest critical charge and the least average Read delay. An extensive simulation based evaluation of process variations is also presented to confirm that using static and Monte Carlo based analysis, the proposed cells are likely to be less affected by process variations (in threshold voltage and effective channel length) than the other cells found in the technical literature.",

        "abstract":"A middleware model named ROAFTS (Real-time Object-oriented Adaptive Fault Tolerance Support) has been evolving in the UCI DREAM Lab. over the past decade as the core of a reliable execution engine model for fault-tolerant (FT) real-time (RT) distributed computing (DC) applications. It is meant to be an integration of various mechanisms for fault detection and recovery in a form that meshes well with high-level RT DC object-\/component- based programming, in particular, TMO (Time-triggered Message-triggered Object) programming. Using ROAFTS as a backbone and low-layer middleware, we developed a model and a skeleton implementation for FT DC middleware providing efficient FT execution services for component-based home network applications. Capabilities for management of home information processing devices, including health monitoring of home devices, reconfiguration of device connections, and servicing queries on device status, were added to ROAFTS. Those additions were first designed as a network of high-level RT DC components, i.e., TMOs. Then the TMO network was extended into an FT TMO network by applying the replication scheme called the PSTR (Primary-Shadow TMO Replication) scheme and incorporating a component responsible for reconfiguring TMO replicas. This extension of ROAFTS is called ROAFTS-HNE (Home Network Extension) and its architecture is presented here. In addition, during the development of the ROAFTS-HNE model, we formulated a new approach for applying the PSTR scheme to RT DC components supported by ROAFTS. Finally, evaluations of the recovery times of a prototype implementation have been conducted.",

In fact, images, videos, music, and other kinds of multimedia objects today constitute about 99% of the Web. Nonetheless, users' chances of a successful search in such a large portion of information are not proportionally supported. Web search is dominated by giants like Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft that exploit centralized text-only indices enriched by an endless toolbox of smart ranking algorithms. Their interest in riding this new tide is witnessed by the acquisition of both Flickr and YouTube. On the other hand, content-based search for image, music and videos has been deeply studied in the last years but it is not yet adopted by the industry because of its cost.",

The vertices of T of out-degree zero are leaves. In the Directed Max Leaf problem, we wish to find the maximum number of leaves in an out-branching of a given digraph D (or, to report that D has no out-branching). In the Directedk-Leaf problem, we are given a digraph D and an integral parameter k, and we are to decide whether D has an out-branching with at least k leaves. Recently, Kneis et al. (2008) obtained an algorithm for Directedk-Leaf of running time 4^k@?n^O^(^1^). We describe a new algorithm for Directedk-Leaf of running time 3.72^k@?n^O^(^1^). This algorithms leads to an O(1.9973^n)-time algorithm for solving Directed Max Leaf on a digraph of order n. The latter algorithm is the first algorithm of running time O(@c^n) for Directed Max Leaf, where @c",

        "abstract":"Due to the huge speed gaps in the memory hierarchy of modern computer architectures, it is important that programs maintain a good data locality. Improving temporal locality implies reducing the distance of data reuses that are far apart. The best existing tools indicate locality bottlenecks by highlighting both the source locations generating the use and the subsequent cache-missing reuse. Even with this knowledge of the bottleneck locations in the source code, it often remains hard to find an effective code refactoring that improves temporal locality, due to the unclear interaction of function calls and loop iterations occurring between use and reuse. The contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, the locality analysis is enhanced to not only pinpoint the cache bottlenecks, but to also suggest code refactorings that may resolve them. The refactorings are found by analyzing the dynamic hierarchy of function calls and loops on the code path between reuses, called reuse paths. Secondly, reservoir sampling of the reuse paths results in a significant reduction of the execution time and memory requirements during profiling, enabling the analysis of realistic programs. An interactive GUI, called SLO (Suggestions for Locality Optimizations), has been used to explore the most appropriate refactorings in a number of SPEC2000 programs. After refactoring, the execution time of the selected programs was halved, on the average.",

It is known that the linear complementarity problem is completely\nequivalent to solving nonlinear equation $F(x)=0$ with $F$ is a function from\n$\\mathrm{IR}^{n}$ into itself defined by $F(x)=(M+I)x+(M-I)|x|+q$. In this\npaper we propose a globally convergent hybrid algorithm for solving this\nequation; this method is based on an algorithm given by Shi \\cite{Y. Shi}, he\nuses vector divisions with the secant method; but for using this method we must\nhave a function continuous with partial derivatives on an open set of\n$\\mathrm{IR}^{n}$; so we built a sequence of functions $\\tilde{F}(p,x)\\in\nC^{\\infty}$ which converges uniformly to the function $F(x)$; and we show that\nfinding the zero of the function $F$ is completely equivalent to finding the\nzero of the sequence of the functions $\\tilde{F}(p,x)$. We close our paper with\nsome numerical simulation examples to illustrate our theoretical results.",

        "abstract":"Broadband wireless access (BWA) networks, such as LTE and WiMAX, are inherently lossy due to wireless medium unreliability. Although the Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) error-control method recovers from packet loss, it has low transmission efficiency and is unsuitable for delay-sensitive applications. Alternatively, network coding techniques improve the throughput of wireless networks, but incur significant overhead and ignore network constraints such as Medium Access Control (MAC) layer transmission opportunities and physical (PHY) layer channel conditions. The present study provides analysis of Random Network Coding (RNC) and Systematic Network Coding (SNC) decoding probabilities. Based on the analytical results, SNC is selected for developing an adaptive network coding scheme designated as Frame-by-frame Adaptive Systematic Network Coding (FASNC). According to network constraints per frame, FASNC dynamically utilizes either Modified Systematic Network Coding (M-SNC) or Mixed Generation Coding (MGC). An analytical model is developed for evaluating the mean decoding delay and mean goodput of the proposed FASNC scheme. The results derived using this model agree with those obtained from computer simulations. Simulations show that FASNC results in both lower decoding delay and reduced buffer requirements compared to MRNC and {\\cal N}-in-1 ReTX, while also yielding higher goodput than HARQ, MRNC, and {\\cal N}-in-1 ReTX.",

The information can be hidden from indexing systems by embedding in multimedia materials. Finding such materials is a large challenge of contemporary criminal analysis. A concept of integrating a large scale Web crawling system with a multimedia materials analysis algorithms is described in this paper. The Web crawling system, which is processing a few hundred pages per second, provides a mechanism for plugin inclusion. A plugin can analyze processed resources and detect references to multimedia materials. The references are passed to a component, which implements an algorithm for image or video analysis. Several approaches to the integration are described and some exemplary implementation assumptions are presented.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new deinterlacing algorithm using edge direction field, edge parity, and motion expansion scheme. The algorithm consists of an EDI (edge dependent interpolation)-based intra-field deinterlacing and inter-field deinterlacing that uses block-based motion detection. Most of the EDI algorithms use pixel-by-pixel or block-by-block distance to estimate the edge direction, which results in many annoying artifacts. We propose the edge direction field, and estimate an interpolation direction using the field and SAD (sum of absolute differences) values. The edge direction field is a set of edge orientations and their gradient magnitudes. The proposed algorithm assumes that a local minimum around the gradient edge field is most probably the true edge direction. Our approach provides good visual results in various kinds of edges (horizontal, narrow and weak). And we propose a new temporal interpolation method based on block motion detection. The algorithm works reliably in scenes which have very fast moving objects and low SNR signals. Experimental results on various data set show that the proposed algorithm works well for the diverse kinds of sequences and reconstructs flicker-free details in the static region1.",

        "abstract":"It is well-known that approximating the chromatic number within a factor of n 1 \u9a74 \u9a74 cannot be done in polynomial time for any \u9a74 0, unless coRP = NP. Also, it is known that computing the list-chromatic number is much harder than the chromatic number (assuming that the complexity classes NP and coNP are different). In fact, the problem of deciding if a given graph is f-list-colorable for a function f : V \u9a74{k \u9a74 1,k} for k \u9a74 3 is \u9a74 2 p -complete.In this paper, we are concerned with the following questions: 1 Given a graph embedded on a surface of bounded genus, what is its list-chromatic number ? 1 Given a graph embedded on a surface of bounded genus with list-chromatic number k, what is the least l (l \u9a74 k) such that the graph can be efficiently and legally colored given a list (coloring scheme) of order l ? The seminal result of Thomassen [19] gives rise to answers for these problems when a given graph is planar. In fact, he gave a polynomial time algorithm to 5-list-color a planar graph. Thomassen's result together with the hardness result (distinguishing between 3, 4 and 5 list-colorability is NP-complete for planar graphs and bounded genus graphs) gives an additive approximation algorithm for list-coloring planar graphs within 2 of the list-chromatic number.Our main result is to extend this result to bounded genus graphs. In fact, our algorithm gives a list-coloring when each vertex has a list with at least \u9a74 l (G) + 2 colors available. The time complexity is O(n).It also generalizes the other deep result of Thomassen [20] who gave an additive approximation algorithm for graph-coloring bounded genus graphs within 2 of the chromatic number.This theorem can be compared to the result by Kawarabayashi and Mohar(STOC'06) who gave an O(k)-approximation algorithm for list-coloring graphs with no K k -minors. For minor-closed graphs, there is a 2-approximation algorithm for graph-coloring by Demaine, Hajiaghayi and Kawarabayashi (FOCS'05), but it seems that there is a huge gap between list-coloring and graph-coloring in minor-closed family of graphs. On the other hand, this is not the case for bounded genus graphs, as we pointed out above.",

        "abstract":"Currently, adaptive educational hypermedia systems (AEHSs) are described using nonuniform methods, depending on the specific view of the system, the application, or other parameters. There is no common language for expressing the functionality of AEHSs, hence these systems are difficult to compare and analyze. In this paper we investigate how a logical description can be employed to characterize adaptive educational hypermedia. We propose a definition of AEHSs based on first-order logic, characterize some AEHSs resulting from this formalism, and discuss the applicability of this approach.",

        "abstract":"This paper describes a new algorithm for recovering the 3D shape and motion of deformable and articulated objects purely from uncalibrated 2D image measurements using an iterative factorization approach. Most solutions to non- rigid and articulated structure from motion require metric constraints to be enforced on the motion matrix to solve for the transformation that upgrades the solution to met- ric space. While in the case of rigid structure the metric upgrade step is simple since the motion constraints are lin- ear, deformability in the shape introduces non-linearities. In this paper we propose an alternating least-squares ap- proach associated with a globally optimal projection step onto the manifold of metric constraints. An important ad- vantageof this new algorithm is its ability to handle missing data which becomes crucial when dealing with real video sequences with self-occlusions. We show successful results of our algorithms on synthetic and real sequences of both deformable and articulated data.",

        "abstract":"This paper develops a method that maps an enhanced Entity-Relationship (ER+) schema into a relational schema and normalizes the latter into an inclusion normal form (IN-NF). Unlike classical normalization that concerns individual relations only, IN-NF takes interrelational redundancies into account and characterizes a relational database schema as a whole. The paper formalizes the sources of such interrelational redundancies in ER+ schemas and specifies the method to detect them. Also, we describe briefly a Prolog implementation of the method, developed in the context of a Computed-Aided Software Engineering shell and present a case study.",

        "abstract":"Much attention has been paid to the theoretical explanation of the empirical success of AdaBoost. The most influential work is the margin theory, which is essentially an upper bound for the generalization error of any voting classifier in terms of the margin distribution over the training data. However, important questions were raised about the margin explanation. Breiman (1999) proved a bound in terms of the minimum margin, which is sharper than the margin distribution bound. He argued that the minimum margin would be better in predicting the generalization error. Grove and Schuurmans (1998) developed an algorithm called LP-AdaBoost which maximizes the minimum margin while keeping all other factors the same as AdaBoost. In experiments however, LP-AdaBoost usually performs worse than AdaBoost, putting the margin explanation into serious doubt. In this paper, we make a refined analysis of the margin theory. We prove a bound in terms of a new margin measure called the Equilibrium margin (Emargin). The Emargin bound is uniformly sharper than Breiman's minimum margin bound. Thus our result suggests that the minimum margin may be not crucial for the generalization error. We also show that a large Emargin and a small empirical error at Emargin imply a smaller bound of the generalization error. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that AdaBoost usually has a larger Emargin and a smaller test error than LP-AdaBoost, which agrees well with our theory.",

We intro-duce aspects of human embodied engagement in the world with the goal of inspiring new interaction design ap-proaches and evaluations that better integrate the physical and computational worlds.",

        "abstract":"Job scheduling has always been a challenging task in modern manufacturing and the most real life scheduling problems which involves multi-criteria and multi-machine environments. In this research our direction is largely motivated by the adoption of the Just-In-Time (JIT) philosophy in parallel machines system, where processing times of jobs are controllable. The goal of this paper is to minimize total weighted tardiness and earliness besides jobs compressing and expanding costs, depending on the amount of compression\/expansion as well as maximum completion time called makespan simultaneously. Jobs due dates are distinct and no inserted idle time is allowed after starting machine processing. Also each machine is capable of processing only some predetermined jobs and operations with probably different speeds. A Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model is proposed to formulate such a problem and is solved optimally in small size instances. A Parallel Net Benefit Compression-Net Benefit Expansion (PNBC-NBE) heuristic is then presented to acquire the optimal jobs set amount of compression and expansion processing times in a given sequence. To solve medium-to-large size cases, a proposed heuristic, two meta-heuristics and a hybrid technique are also employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid procedure is a proficient method and could efficiently solve such complicated problems.",

        "abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of image denoising when the image is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. We herein propose a spatial adaptive denoising method which is based on an averaging process performed on a set of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulations of region partition maps constrained to be spatially piecewise uniform (i.e., constant in grey level value sense) for each estimated constant-value regions. For the estimation of these region partition maps, we have adopted the unsupervised Markovian framework in which parameters are automatically estimated in the least square sense. This sequential averaging allows to obtain, under our image model, an approximation of the image to be recovered in the minimal mean square sense error. The experiments reported in this paper demonstrate that the discussed method performs competitively and sometimes better than the best existing state-of-the-art wavelet-based denoising methods in benchmark tests.",

        "abstract":"Nowadays, it is common to use nondestructive sensors to monitor property variations in biological systems. The repeated observations on the time varying system are referred to as repeated measurements. In many applications, it is important to develop a Bayesian classifier based on repeated measurements data to assure proper class identification. However, its implementation is complex due to the multidimensional and discontinuous nature of the decision boundaries. In this work, the problem of correlated data to develop a Bayesian Classifier for a multiclass problem is addressed. The effect of correlation on the classification error rate is discussed. It was found that additional correlated data does not improve the classifier likelihood for highly correlated repeated measures. Also, it is shown that error classification is adversely affected by correlation between repeated measures. Finally, a strategy to develop a multiclass Bayesian classifier from multisensory repeated measurements data is presented.",

        "abstract":"In this paper we explore an interesting relationship between discrete-time quantum walks and the Ihara zeta function of a graph. The paper commences by reviewing the related literature on the discrete-time quantum walks and the Ihara zeta function. Mathematical definitions of the two concepts are then provided, followed by analyzing the relationship between them. Based on this analysis we are able to account for why the Ihara zeta function can not distinguish cospectral regular graphs. This analysis suggests a means by which to develop zeta functions that have potential in distinguishing such structures.",

The subsequent versions of the protocol are obtained from their predecessors by well controlled and small modifications that (almost) obviously preserve correctness. Hence, the correctness of the final version is assured by virtue of the original proof which could have remained relatively simple and elegant exactly because was not involved in realization details. The target, successful (successful with arbitrarily high probability) solution allows forgetting theoretical \"impossibility results\", which prove non-existence of such successful distributed solutions for some c lasses of networks that abstractly are c haracterized by, so called, \"ambiguous\" graphs.",

        "abstract":"Thermal monitoring of a design plays a vital role to ensure safe and reliable thermal operating conditions. Thermal monitoring by employing thermal sensors is a popular technique for assessing thermal behavior and providing directives for run-time preventive measures. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a wide range of functionalities and therefore static placement of thermal sensors during fabrication process is inefficient and inappropriate for such resource constrained devices. In such cases, dynamic reconfiguration is shown to be effective for thermal monitoring because the resources required to instantiate sensors and their exact placement might conflict with the placed and routed circuit. However, instantiating a large number of sensors will incur significant reconfiguration overhead. Our goal is to assist the dynamic reconfiguration based sensor placement approach such that it becomes more efficient. In this paper we present our Longest Edge Rectangular Bisection algorithm, that minimizes the number of required sensors and controls their distribution on the reconfigurable fabric. Our algorithm effectively monitors the design and maintains a given accuracy level in temperature sensing. For a set of hotspots distributed across different logic array sizes, our algorithm reduces the number of required sensors by 69.5% and 17.5% on an average, when compared to a uniform grid-based placement and a more efficient circular intersection based placement respectively.",

        "abstract":"There is a lot of existing research focusing on low power mobile computing, but only a fraction of it takes systematic view toward the whole system. Our research is motivated by two important facts: the first is that processor, SDRAM and chipset consume more than 60% energy on mobile device, and the second is that mobile device usually moves inside a heterogeneous \"computer community\" that are interconnected by heterogeneous network. Targeting on low power mobile computing, we propose heterogeneous grid computing that enables mobile device to migrate work load to other computers, which have far more resources and are powered by AC. The off-loading can reduce majority of local computation related energy consumption. Meanwhile, since most mobile applications have asymmetric UI, the energy consumption on wireless interface will not be significantly increased. In order to support the proposed heterogeneous grid computing, we develop an UPnP based architecture that leverages a lot of industry standard. Three applications are developed on our tested: multimedia streaming, 3D game and Text to Speech. Experiments show that battery life time is radically prolonged.",

        "abstract":"There exists a large variety of techniques to detect and correct software security vulnerabilities at the source code level, including human code reviews, testing, and static analysis. In this article, we present a static analysis approach that supports both the identification of security flaws and the reasoning about security concerns. We introduce an ontology-based program representation that lets security experts and programmers specify their security concerns as part of the ontology. Within our tool implementation, we support complex queries on the underlying program model using either predefined or user-defined concepts and relations. Queries regarding security concerns, such as exception handling, object accessibility etc. are demonstrated in order to show the applicability and flexibility of our approach.",

We prove that a reliable evaluation of the corresponding Shannon entropy can be done by exploiting some known theoretical results on the entropy convergence, uniquely involving exact moments without solving the underlying moment problem. All the procedure essentially rests on the solution of linear systems, with nearly singular matrices, and hence it requires both calculations in high precision and a pre-conditioning technique. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical results.",

        "abstract":"Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) allows the non-invasive study of muscle fiber architecture but musculoskeletal DTI suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio. Noise in the computed tensor fields can lead to poorly reconstructed muscle fiber fields. This paper describes an algorithm for producing denoised muscle fiber fields from noisy diffusion tensor data as well as its preliminary validation. The algorithm computes a denoised vector field by finding the components of its Helmholtz\u2013Hodge decomposition that optimally match the diffusion tensor field. A key feature of the algorithm is that it performs denoising of the vector field simultaneously with its extraction from the noisy tensor field. This allows the vector field reconstruction to be constrained by the architectural properties of skeletal muscles. When compared to primary eigenvector fields extracted from noisy synthetic data, the denoised vector fields show greater similarity to the ground truth for signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 20 to 5. Similarity greater than 0.9 (in terms of fiber direction) is observed for all signal-to-noise ratios, for smoothing parameter values greater than or equal to 10 (larger values yield more smoothing). Fiber architectures were computed from human forearm diffusion tensor data using extracted primary eigenvectors and the denoised data. Qualitative comparison of the fiber fields showed that the denoised fields were anatomically more plausible than the noisy fields. From the results of experiments using both synthetic and real MR datasets we conclude that the denoising algorithm produces anatomically plausible fiber architectures from diffusion tensor images with a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.",

        "abstract":"e-Services are just like normal services, but can be ordered and provisioned via the Internet completely. Increasingly, these e-services are offered as a multi-supplier bundle of elementary services. How to automatically compose and prioritize these multi-supplier e-service bundles is considered as a key problem. In this paper, we present the e3serviceontology to represent a multi-supplier e-service catalogue from a consumer need perspective. Then, we use this ontology to reason about alternative e-service bundles satisfying a particular need, and to prioritize the found bundles using the consumer benefits they provide. The ontology and the reasoning process are illustrated by a case study in the Dutch telecommunication industry.",

        "abstract":"This paper considers a multi-period portfolio selection problem imposed by return demand and risk control in a fuzzy investment environment, in which the returns of assets are characterized by fuzzy numbers. A fuzzy lower semi-deviation is originally defined as the risk control of portfolio. A proportion entropy constraint is added as the divergence measure of portfolio. Based on the theories of possibility and necessity measures, a new multi-period portfolio optimization model with return demand and risk control is proposed. And then, the proposed model is transformed into a crisp nonlinear programming problem by using fuzzy programming approach. Furthermore, an improved differential evolution algorithm is designed for obtaining the optimal strategy. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the practicality and efficiency of the proposed model and the corresponding algorithm.",

        "abstract":"Heterogeneous distributed systems are widely deployed for executing computationally intensive parallel applications with diverse computing needs. Such environments require effective scheduling strategies that take into account both algorithmic and architectural characteristics. Unfortunately, most of the scheduling algorithms developed for such systems rely on a simple platform model where communication contention is not taken into account. In addition, it is generally assumed that processors are completely safe. To schedule precedence graphs in a more realistic framework, we introduce first an efficient fault-tolerant scheduling algorithm that is both contention-aware and capable of supporting an arbitrary number of fail-silent (fail-stop) processor failures. Next, we derive a more complex heuristic that departs from the main principle of the first algorithm. Instead of considering a single task (one with highest priority) and assigning all its replicas to the currently best available resources, we consider a chunk of ready tasks, and assign all their replicas in the same decision making procedure. This leads to a better load balance of processors and communication links. We focus on a bi-criteria approach, where we aim at minimizing the total execution time, or latency, given a fixed number of failures supported in the system. Our algorithms have a low time complexity, and drastically reduce the number of additional communications induced by the replication mechanism. Experimental results fully demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms, which lead to efficient execution schemes while guaranteeing a prescribed level of fault-tolerance.",

The development of exascale systems made it clear that extrapolations\n of current technologies, algorithmic practices and performance metrics are simply inadequate. The community reacted by introducing\n the FLOPS\/WATT metric in order to promote energy awareness. In this work we take a step forward and argue what one should aim for is the\n total reduction of the spent energy in conjunction with minimization of time to solution. Thus, we propose to use f(time\n to\n solution)\u22c5energy (FTTSE) as the performance metric, where f(\u22c5) is an application dependent function of time. In this paper, we introduce our ideas and showcase them with a recently\n developed framework for solving large dense linear systems.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The development of algorithms to infer the structure of gene regulatory networks based on expression data is an important subject in bioinformatics research. Validation of these algorithms requires benchmark data sets for which the underlying network is known. Since experimental data sets of the appropriate size and design are usually not available, there is a clear need to generate well-characterized synthetic data sets that allow thorough testing of learning algorithms in a fast and reproducible manner. RESULTS: In this paper we describe a network generator that creates synthetic transcriptional regulatory networks and produces simulated gene expression data that approximates experimental data. Network topologies are generated by selecting subnetworks from previously described regulatory networks. Interaction kinetics are modeled by equations based on Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics. Our results show that the statistical properties of these topologies more closely approximate those of genuine biological networks than do those of different types of random graph models. Several user-definable parameters adjust the complexity of the resulting data set with respect to the structure learning algorithms. CONCLUSION: This network generation technique offers a valid alternative to existing methods. The topological characteristics of the generated networks more closely resemble the characteristics of real transcriptional networks. Simulation of the network scales well to large networks. The generator models different types of biological interactions and produces biologically plausible synthetic gene expression data.",

        "abstract":"We consider the problem of finding a best approximation pair, i.e., two points which achieve the minimum distance between two closed convex sets in a Hilbert space. When the sets intersect, the method under consideration, termed AAR for averaged alternating reflections, is a special instance of an algorithm due to Lions and Mercier for finding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators. We investigate systematically the asymptotic behavior of AAR in the general case when the sets do not necessarily intersect and show that the method produces best approximation pairs provided they exist. Finitely many sets are handled in a product space, in which case the AAR method is shown to coincide with a special case of Spingarn's method of partial inverses.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new method for ellipse detection. This method takes the advantages of major axis of an ellipse to find ellipse parameter fast and efficiently. It only needs a one-dimensional accumulator array to accumulate the length information for minor axis of the ellipse. This method does not require the evaluation of the tangents or curvatures of the edge contours, which are generally very sensitive to noisy working conditions. No complicated mathematical computation is involved in the implementation and the required computational storage space is much cheaper compared to the current methods. Experiments with both synthetic and real images indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract":"Despite a growing appreciation of the need to protect sensitive deep sea ecosystems such as cold-water corals, efforts to map the extent of their distribution are limited by their remoteness. Here we develop ecological niche models to predict the likely distributions of cold-water corals based on occurrence records and data describing environmental parameters (e.g. seafloor terrain attributes and oceanographic conditions). This study has used bathymetric data derived from ship-borne multibeam swath systems, species occurrence data from remotely operated vehicle video surveys and oceanographic parameters from hydrodynamic models to predict coral locations in regions where there is a paucity of direct observations. Predictions of the locations of the scleractinian coral, Lophelia pertusa are based primarily upon ecological niche modelling using a genetic algorithm. Its accuracy has been quantified at local (~25\u00a0km2) and regional scales (~4000\u00a0km2) along the Irish continental slope using a variety of error assessment techniques and a comparison with another ecological niche modelling technique. With appropriate choices of parameters and scales of analyses, ecological niche modelling has been effective in predicting the distributions of species at local and regional scales. Refinements of this approach have the potential to be particularly useful for ocean management given the need to manage areas of sensitive habitat where survey data are often limited.",

        "abstract":"The error diffusion method is good for reconstructing continuous tones of an image to bilevel tones. However, the reconstruction of edge information by the error diffusion is represented as weak when the power spectrum is analyzed for display error. In this paper, we present an edge enhanced error diffusion method to preprocess original images to achieve an enhancement for the edge information. The preprocessing algorithm consists of two processes. First, the value of difference between the current pixel and the local average of surrounding pixels in the original image is obtained. Second, weighting function is composed by the magnitude and the sign of the local average. To confirm the effect of proposed method, the method is compared with the standard error diffusion and conventional edge enhanced error diffusion methods by measuring various objective measuring criteria including the radially averaged power spectrum density (RAPSD) for display error. The results of comparison demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional ones.",

        "abstract":"Very large block-level data backup systems need scalable data deduplication and garbage collection techniques to make efficient use of the storage space and to minimize the performance overhead of doing so. Although the deduplication and garbage collection logic is conceptually straight-forward, their implementations pose a significant technical challenge because only a small portion of their associated data structures could fit into memory. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a data deduplication and garbage collection engine called Sungem that is designed to remove duplicate blocks in incremental data backup streams. Sungem features three novel techniques to maximize the deduplication throughput without compromising the deduplication ratio. First, Sungem puts related fingerprint sequences, rather than fingerprints from the same backup stream, into the same container in order to increase the fingerprint prefetching efficiency. Second, to make the most of the memory space reserved for storing fingerprints, Sungem varies the sampling rates for fingerprint sequences based on their stability. Third, Sungem combines reference count and expiration time in a unique way to arrive at the first known incremental garbage collection algorithm whose bookkeeping overhead is proportional to the size of a disk volume's incremental backup snapshot rather than its full backup snapshot. We evaluated the Sungem prototype using a real-world data backup trace, and showed that the average throughput of Sungem is more than 200,000 fingerprint lookups per second on a standard X86 server, including the garbage collection cost.",

        "abstract":"Today major challenges are faced by server platforms while performing TCP\/IP or UDP\/IP protocol processing. For instance, the speed of networks now exceeds the gigabit per sec Gbps, the design and implementations of high-performance Network Interfaces (NI) have become very challenging. There are different possible design approaches to implement high-speed NI. However, using the General Purpose Processing (GPP) as a core engine to offload some, if not all, of the TCP\/IP or UDP\/IP protocol functions can deliver some important features to NIs, such as simplicity, scalability, shorter developing cycle time and reduced costs. Still it is not clear whether the GPP can provide the processing required for high-speed line over 10 Gbps. Also, where is the limit of such GPP in supporting the processing of network interfaces? In this paper, we have measured the amount of processing required for Ethernet Network Interfaces (ENI) design supporting different transmission line speeds. A NI-programmable based RISC model has been designed to measure the processing required for the ENI|. The results have shown that a RISC core running at 240 MHz can be used as a processing core in high-speed ENI. Such core can support a wide range of transmission line speeds, up to 100 Gbps. Also, we have discussed some of the design issues that are related to RISC core based NI and the data movement type.",

        "abstract":"Existing methods for handling routing and dimensioning in dynamic WDM networks solve the two problems separately. The main\n drawback of this approach is that a global minimum cost solution cannot be guaranteed. Given that wavelengths are costly resources,\n determining the minimum network cost is of fundamental importance. We propose an approach which jointly solves the routing\n and dimensioning problems in optical burst switching (OBS) networks, guaranteeing a target blocking per connection. The method\n finds the set of routes and the number of wavelengths per network link that minimise the total network cost. To accomplish\n this, an integer linear programming problem is solved. The proposed method was applied to ring networks, where the optimal\n solution achieves a reduction in the network cost of 10\u201340% (for traffic loads <0.4, compared to solving both problems separately).\n In the case of mesh topologies, to reduce the computational complexity of the method, we applied a variation of it which achieves\n a local minimum. Even so, a reduction of 5\u201320% (for traffic loads\u00a0<0.4) in the network cost was obtained. This ability to\n lower network cost could make the proposed method the best choice to date for dynamic network operators.",

        "abstract":"We consider the problem of planning collision-free paths for a redundant robot manipulator whose end-effector must travel along a specified path. A probabilistic method has been proposed for the problem, which does not allow self-motions of the robot as it moves along the end-effector path. In this paper, we propose an enhancement, which allows such self-motions. This is primarily accomplished by explicitly representing self-motions for a certain pose as a self-motion graph, which is explored with probabilistic techniques for closed-chain robots. Computer simulations show that this enhancement improves performance in most cases. Depending on the limits set on the run-time (always needed in practice for probabilistic sampling methods), the planner with self-motion enhancement will find a path where the original algorithm without self-motion may not",

        "abstract":"  Compressed sensing is designed to measure sparse signals directly in a compressed form. However, most signals of interest are only \"approximately sparse\", i.e. even though the signal contains only a small fraction of relevant (large) components the other components are not strictly equal to zero, but are only close to zero. In this paper we model the approximately sparse signal with a Gaussian distribution of small components, and we study its compressed sensing with dense random matrices. We use replica calculations to determine the mean-squared error of the Bayes-optimal reconstruction for such signals, as a function of the variance of the small components, the density of large components and the measurement rate. We then use the G-AMP algorithm and we quantify the region of parameters for which this algorithm achieves optimality (for large systems). Finally, we show that in the region where the GAMP for the homogeneous measurement matrices is not optimal, a special \"seeding\" design of a spatially-coupled measurement matrix allows to restore optimality.

        "abstract":"At EuroCrypt '08, Gilbert, Robshaw and Seurin proposed HB# to improve on HB + in terms of transmission cost and security against man-in-the-middle attacks. Although the security of HB# is formally proven against a certain class of man-in-the-middle adversaries, it is only conjectured for the general case. In this paper, we present a general man-in-the-middle attack against HB# and Random -HB#, which can also be applied to all anterior HB-like protocols, that recovers the shared secret in 225 or 220 authentication rounds for HB# and 234 or 228 for Random -HB#, depending on the parameter set. We further show that the asymptotic complexity of our attack is polynomial under some conditions on the parameter set which are met on one of those proposed in [8].",

        "abstract":"Because of the high impact of high-tech digital crime upon our society, it is necessary to develop effective Information Retrieval (IR) tools to support digital forensic investigations. In this paper, we propose an IR system for digital forensics that targets emails. Our system incorporates WordNet (i.e. a domain independent ontology for the vocabulary) into an Extended Boolean Model (EBM) by applying query expansion techniques. Structured Boolean queries in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) are utilized to assist investigators in effectively expressing their information requirements. We compare the performance of our system on several email datasets with a traditional Boolean IR system built upon the Lucene keyword-only model. Experimental results show that our system yields a promising improvement in retrieval performance without the requirement of very accurate query keywords to retrieve the most relevant emails.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents some highlights in the application of neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and rough sets to automated knowledge acquisition. These techniques are capable of dealing with inexact and imprecise problem domains and have been demonstrated to be useful in the solution of classification problems. It addresses the issue of the application of appropriate evaluation criteria such as rule base accuracy and comprehensibility for new knowledge acquisition techniques. An empirical study is then described in which three approaches to knowledge acquisition are investigated. The first approach combines neural networks and fuzzy logic, the second, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic, and in the third a rough sets approach has been examined, and compared. In this study neural network and genetic algorithm fuzzy rule induction systems have been developed and applied to three classification problems. Rule induction software based on rough sets theory was also used to generate and test rule bases for the same data. A comparison of these approaches with the C4.5 inductive algorithm was also carried out. Our research to date indicates that, based on the evaluation criteria used, the genetic\/fuzzy approach compares more than favourably with the neuro\/fuzzy and rough set approaches. On the data sets used the genetic algorithm system displays a higher accuracy of classification and rule base comprehensibility than the C4.5 inductive algorithm. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

        "abstract":"Multiple coordinated visualizations enable users to rapidly explore complex information. However, users often need unforeseen combinations of coordinated visualizations that are appropriate for their data. Snap-Together Visualization enables data users to rapidly and dynamically mix and match visualizations and coordinations to construct custom exploration interfaces without programming. Snap's conceptual model is based on the relational database model. Users load relations into visualizations then coordinate them based on the relational joins between them. Users can create different types of coordinations such as: brushing, drill down, overview and detail view, and synchronized scrolling. Visualization developers can make their independent visualizations snap-able with a simple API.Evaluation of Snap revealed benefits, cognitive issues, and usability concerns. Data savvy users were very capable and thrilled to rapidly construct powerful coordinated visualizations. A snapped overview and detail-view coordination improved user performance by 30-80%, depending on task.",

        "abstract":"XACML policy evaluation efficiency is an important factor influencing the overall system performance, especially when the number of policies grows. Some existing approaches on high performance XACML policy evaluation can support simple policies with equality comparisons and handle requests with well defined conditions. Such mechanisms do not provide the semantic correctness of combining algorithms in cases with indeterminate and not-applicable states. They ignore the critical attribute setting, a mandatory property in XACML, leading to potential missing attribute attacks. In this paper, we present a solution using data interval partition aggregation together with new decision diagram combinations, that not only optimizes the performance but also provides correctness and completeness of XACML 3.0 features, including complex logical expressions, correctness in indeterminate states processing, critical attribute setting, obligations and advices as well as complex comparison functions for multiple data types.",

        "abstract":"A pragmatic approach has been developed for the estimation of aqueous ionization constants (pK(a)) for druglike compounds. The method involves an algorithm that assigns ionization constants in a stepwise manner to the acidic and basic groups present in a compound. Predictions are made for each ionizable group using models derived from semiempirical quantum chemical properties and information-based descriptors. Semiempirical properties include the partial charge and electrophilic superdelocalizabilty of the atom(s) undergoing protonation or deprotonation. Importantly, the latter property has been extended to allow predictions to be made for multiprotic compounds, overcoming limitations of a previous approach described by Tehan et al. The information-based descriptions include molecular-tree structured fingerprints, based on the methodology outlined by Xing et al., with the addition of 2D substructure flags indicating the presence of other important structural features. These two classes of descriptor were found to complement one another particularly well, resulting in predictive models for a range of functional groups (including alcohols, amidines, amines, anilines, carboxylic acids, guanidines, imidazoles, imines, phenols, pyridines, and pyrimidines). A combined RMSE of 0.48 and 0.81 was obtained for the training set and an external test set compounds, respectively. The predictive models were based on compounds selected from the commercially available BioLoom database. The resultant speed and accuracy of the approach has also enabled the development of Web application on the Novartis intranet for pK(a) prediction.",

It can not only improve the reuse capability of service, but also reduce difficulty of discovering service and matching service. Thereby, make the orchestration of service easy. As a generalization of interoperability check between services, parameterized contracts can be applied to service tailoring.

        "abstract":"As a result of increased attention to medical errors, many institutions are contemplating increased use of information technology and clinical decision support. We conducted a retrospective analysis to estimate the frequency and cost of adverse drug events (ADEs) for inpatients at the University of Virginia. Applying published criteria for the detection of potential adverse events, we used a clinical data warehouse to identify patients and cases with potential ADEs. Again using published criteria, we then estimated the actual number of adverse drug events and preventable adverse drug events, as well as their attributable costs and excess length of stay. Our results showed a higher estimate (10.4-11.5 events per 100 admissions) for ADEs than seen in the ADE Prevention Study, highlighting the importance of considering the generalizability of published ADE studies to other settings. Our analysis demonstrates that retrospective analysis can be an efficient and powerful technique to evaluate rules and criteria used to detect ADEs and to assess their impact.",

        "abstract":"Theoretical research is predominately an inductive process; while applied research is mainly a deductive process. Both inference processes are based on the cognitive process and means of abstraction. This paper describes the cognitive processes of abstraction and formal inferences such as deduction, induction, abduction, and analogy. The hierarchy of abstraction and the descriptivity of abstract means at different levels are analyzed. A set of mathematical models of formal inference methodologies are developed. Formal descriptions of the five cognitive processes of abstraction and inferences are presented using real-time process algebra (RTPA). Applications of abstraction and formal inferences in dealing with complicated problems in large-scale software system development in software engineering are discussed.",

        "abstract":"Problem formulation is often an important first step for solving a problem effectively. In sequential decision problems, Markov decision process (MDP) ([2]; [22]) is a model formulation that has been commonly used, due to its generality, flexibility, and applicability to a wide range of problems. Despite these advantages, there are three necessary conditions that must be satisfied before the MDP model can be applied; that is, \r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThe environment model is given in advance (a completely-known environment).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe environment states are completely observable (fully-observable states, implying a Markovian environment).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThe environment parameters do not change over time (a stationary environment).",

Then the equivalence between two-sided two-cosided Hopf modules and Yetter\u2014Drinfel\u2019d modules, proved in [8], becomes an equivalence between categories of Doi\u2014Hopf modules.

        "abstract":"Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is one of the recently emerged dimensionality reduction methods. Unlike other methods, NMF is based on non-negative constraints, which allows learn parts from objects. In this paper a performance comparison of PCA and NMF, which are data preprocessing algorithms in remote sensing imagery classification, is presented. PCA and NMF are applied to a remote sensing imagery (128 times 128), obtained from Shunyi, Beijing. For classification, a maximum likelihood classification method is used for the preprocessed data. The results show that classification with NMF has more confident results than that with PCA. NMF keeps more abundant texture information.",

        "abstract":"The DNER&LO study gathered data about 27 elearning projects, mapping the categories of content being produced, and approaches to reusability and interoperability. Eighteen were chosen for closer study and evaluation, based on availability of content, and on covering a wide range of content categories. Appropriate reusability evaluation criteria were developed specifically for the study, in four areas: aggregation level; reusability; subject specificity; and vertical reusability. Developing the criteria definitions in the light of real, varied content illuminated the present lack of a widely used, authoritative elearning terminology. Although the projects were planned before reusability was a widely promoted goal, they showed high levels of awareness of, and willingness to plan for, reusability and interoperability. The content itself, evaluated according to the criteria, showed good potential for reuse, or for being made reusable. Any gaps between the awareness levels of developers and actual reusability of content supported the idea that planning, and budgeting from the start for the complex process of developing reusable resources is imperative, if the potential of learning technology for sharing resources is to be fulfilled. Gaining support from sources such as the UK's CETIS is one way to ensure available expertise is utilised.",

        "abstract":"Norms (permissions, obligations and prohibitions) offer a useful and powerful abstraction with which to capture social constraints in multi-agent systems. Norms should exclude disruptive or antisocial behaviour without prescribing the design of individual agents or restricting their autonomy. An important challenge, however, in the design and management of systems governed by norms is that norms may, at times, conflict with one another; e.g, an action may be simultaneously prohibited and obliged for a particular agent. In such circumstances, agents no longer have the option of complying with these norms; whatever they do or refrain from doing will lead to a social constraint being broken. In this paper, we present mechanisms for the detection and resolution of normative conflicts. These mechanisms, based on first-order unification and constraint solving techniques, are the building blocks of more sophisticated algorithms we present for the management of normative positions, that is, the adoption and removal of permissions, obligations and prohibitions in societies of agents. We capture both direct and indirect conflicts between norms, formalise a practical concept of authority, and model conflicts that may arise as a result of delegation. We are able to formally define classic ways for resolving conflicts such as lex superior and lex posterior.",

        "abstract":"One of the most important tasks in data cleansing is to detect and remove duplicate records, which consists of two main components, detection and comparison. A detection method decides which records will be compared, and a comparison method determines whether two records compared are duplicate. Comparisons take a great deal of data cleansing time. We discover that if certain properties are satisfied by a comparison method then many unnecessary expensive comparisons can be avoided. In this paper, we first propose a new comparison method, LCSS, based on the longest common subsequence, and show that it possesses the desired properties. We then propose two new detection methods, SNM-IN and SNM-INOUT, which are variances of the popular detection method SNM. The performance study on real and synthetic databases shows that the integration of SNM-IN (SNM-INOUT) and LCSS saves about 39% (56%) of comparisons.",

We explain the elements of the algorithm such as chromosome structure, fitness function, crossover, mutation, and local improvement operations and solve more than 220 problems with known optimal solutions to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

        "abstract":"With the rapid development of wireless technologies, the need to support moving hosts of IPv6-based mobile networks in ubiquitous environment is growing. So the demand for delay sensitive applications, such as multimedia stream, VoIP, that requires increasingly seamless handover.Various well-known approaches to optimize the handover latency have been proposed in the literature: MIPv6, FMIPv6, HMIPv6 and FHMIPv6. However, these approaches are inefficient in handover delay, packet loss, out-of order problem, dependency of exacty predictive information, a sudden disruption of the link and so on. In this paper, we propose an enhanced fast handover scheme with temporal reuse of Care of Addresses (CoAs) and Packet Buffering Point (PBP) in IPv6-based mobile networks.The proposal reduces the handover latency, handover initiation time through the temporal reuse of CoAs as tentative addresses already proved unique by other mobile node(MN) using DAD(Duplicate Address Detection). It also solves the packet loss and out-of order problem by PBP which is the above router between previous Access Router (pAR) and new Access Router (nAR).",

        "abstract":"Few women major in Computer Science (CS), which creates a serious bottleneck of women qualified to enter into the CS workforce. To address this bottleneck, this study examines gender issues in CS education. We assessed whether gender differences in CS students' stereotypes of CS and attitudes towards CS classes and the CS program remain stable from one semester to the next. We found that gender differences in CS students are not temporally stable and conclude that one-time assessments of gender differences may lead to erroneous conclusions. We also found that concerns about future work-family conflicts and gender issues in the CS program (e.g., female CS students feeling that they are not being taken as seriously as male CS students) emerged as important concerns for female CS students.0The implications of these findings for increasing the representation of women in CS are discussed.",

However the traditional database encryption schemes cannot well balance the tradeoff between security performance and efficiency because of the efficiency declining due to encryption, besides they did not solve the problem of storing multi-level encrypted elements within a database or a table, also they seldom focus on key management. This paper proposes a novel efficient database encryption scheme so as to solve the problems mentioned above. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.",

We propose a method that precomputes multinode cubic panorama movies using Quick-Time-VR. This technique allows almost the same navigation and visualization capabilities as a real endoscopic procedure, a significant reduction of interaction input is achieved and the movie represents a document of the procedure.",

        "abstract":"Multibiometric systems fuse information from different sources to compensate for the limitations in performance of individual matchers. We propose a framework for optimal combination of match scores that is based on the likelihood ratio test. The distributions of genuine and impostor match scores are modeled as finite Gaussian mixture model. The proposed fusion approach is general in its ability to handle (i) discrete values in biometric match score distributions, (ii) arbitrary scales and distributions of match scores, (iii) correlation between the scores of multiple matchers and (iv) sample quality of multiple biometric sources. Experiments on three multibiometric databases indicate that the proposed fusion framework achieves consistently high performance compared to commonly used score fusion techniques based on score transformation and classification.",

        "abstract":"Face recognition is an active research area due to its wide range of practical applications. Efficient and discriminative facial feature is a crucial issue for face recognition. Most existing methods use one type of features but we show that robust face recognition requires different kinds of feature information to be taken into account. Traditional feature fusion methods are based on the linear combination. In this study, we propose a novel and effective fusion method (called NF-PCF), which uses polynomial correlation filter (PCF) to non-linearly fuse different types of features for robust face recognition. Experimental results on two popular face databases, including Yale and PIE, show the promising results obtained by the proposed method. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

        "abstract":"Ship autopilots are usually designed based on Proportional Differential (PD) and Proportional Integrate Differential (PID)\n controllers because of their simplicity, reliability, and ease of construction. However, their performance in various environmental\n conditions is not as good as desired. This disadvantage can be overcome by adjusting works or constructing adaptive controllers,\n although these methods are complex and not easy. This article presents a new method for constructing a ship autopilot based\n on the combination of fuzzy logic control (FLC) and linear control theory (@#@ PID control). The new ship autopilot has the advantages of both the PID and FLC control methodologies: ease of construction,\n and optimal control laws can be established based on ship master knowledge. Therefore, the new ship autopilot can be well\n adapted with parameter variations and strong environment effects. Simulation using MATLAB software for a ship with real parameters\n showed high effectiveness of the fuzzy PID autopilot in course-keeping and course-changing maneuvers in comparison with the\n ordinary PID ship autopilots.",

        "abstract":"We consider joint pricing and capacity decisions for a facility serving heterogeneous consumers that span a continuous range of locations, and are sensitive to time delays. Within this context, we analyze two contrasting service strategies: segmentation and pooling. Consumer segments differ with respect to their reservation prices and time sensitivities, and are dispersed over a single distance dimension. The firm serves these consumers using a process that we initially model as an M\/M\/1 queuing system. We analyze profit-maximizing price and capacity levels for a monopolist, and contrast the optimal segmentation and pooling policies. We find that when consumers are time sensitive, and can expect queuing delays at the firm\u2019s facility (due to random arrival and service times), then scale economies from pooling can outweigh segmentation benefits. Yet, segmentation outperforms pooling when consumer segments differ substantively, in which case the firm can use capacity as a lever to price discriminate between the segments. Moreover, by contrasting a dedicated-services strategy, which directly targets specific segments and serves them separately, with the alternative of allowing consumers to self-select, we find that self-selection has a moderate negative influence on profits. We also examine the profit impact of employing alternative queuing systems, and find that a hybrid strategy based on a prioritized queuing discipline, that combines elements of segmentation (by offering different waiting times) and pooling (by sharing capacity across consumer segments), can outperform both the pure segmentation and pooling strategies.",

        "abstract":"This paper analyzes the impact on power consumption of two DVFS-control strategies when applied to the execution of dense linear algebra operations on multi-core processors. The strategies considered here, prototyped as the Slack Reduction Algorithm (SRA) and the Race-to-Idle Algorithm (RIA), adjust the operation frequency of the cores during execution of a collection of tasks (in which many dense linear algebra algorithms can be decomposed) with a very different approach to save energy. A power-aware simulator, in charge of scheduling the execution of tasks to processor cores, is employed to evaluate the performance benefits of these power-control policies for two reference algorithms for the LU factorization, a key operation for the solution of linear systems of equations.",

        "abstract":"Most exponentiation algorithms are categorised as being left-to-right or right-to-left because of the order in which they use the digits of the exponent. There is clear value in having a canonical way of transforming an algorithm in one direction into an algorithm in the opposite direction: it may lead to new algorithms, different implementations of existing algorithms, improved side-channel resistance, greater insights. There is already an historic duality between left-to-right and right-to-left exponentiation algorithms which shows they take essentially the same time, but it does not treat the space issues that are always so critical in resource constrained embedded crypto-systems. To address this, here is presented a canonical duality which preserves both time and space. As an example, this is applied to derive a new, fast yet compact, left-to-right algorithm which makes optimal use of recently developed composite elliptic curve operations.",

        "abstract":"In this article, a new infrastructure of a combined Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) link layer is proposed with the purpose of reducing simultaneous WiMAX connections. WiMAX offers wide area connectivity of vehicles to ground-based base stations, while DSRC offers relatively shorter communication that allows for vehicles in proximity of each other to communicate directly. The proposed design uses the fact that WiMAX amendments support the concept of a WiMAX relay node, and substitutes the WiMAX relay nodes with nodes that are capable of both WiMAX and DSRC communications. This change allows for the number of WiMAX connections to be concentrated while supporting more subscribing users via WiMAX tunnelled over DSRC relay. The focus of this design is on the use case of providing broadband Internet access to a large number of DSRC capable vehicles in a WiMAX served region. The design uses DSRC as a WiMAX tunnel, but with changes to the WiMAX protocol, specifically network entry and handover processes are redesigned to have different behaviour only when operating over DSRC. Network entry over DSRC modifications are described and illustrated with comparison to existing WiMAX standards. Handover process facilitated over both WiMAX and DSRC layers are described, illustrated and are also standard compliant. Unified modeling language is used to assist with the explanations of the components to improve understanding of the design in relation to existing WiMAX standards. In addition to standard WiMAX operability, the design can also support WiMAX data subscription using a software-defined WiMAX radio via DSRC relay connectivity. This proposed design improves WiMAX communication by reducing the number of WiMAX connections between vehicles. We plotted the throughput of various cluster sizes of WiMAX only mobile relay, versus our proposed DSRC-enabled WiMAX mobile relay in order to show the efficiency benefit of our design. We also provide a simulated curve of percentage improvement efficiency for varying amount of active users. We show that as the total number of users in the system increases, our proposed system significantly improves the overall system efficiency, especially in heavily congested traffic.",

        "abstract":"Microarray experiments generate a large amount of data which is used to discover the genetic background of diseases and to know the characteristics of genes. Clustering the tissue samples according to their co-expressed behavior and characteristics is an important tool for partitioning the dataset. Finding the clusters of a given dataset is a difficult task. This task of clustering is even more difficult when we try to find the rank of each gene, which is known as Gene Ranking, according to their abilities to distinguish different classes of samples. In the literature, many algorithms are available for sample clustering and gene ranking or selection, separately. A few algorithms are also available for simultaneous clustering and feature selection. In this article, we have proposed a new approach for clustering the samples and ranking the genes, simultaneously. A novel encoding technique for the chromosomes is proposed for this purpose and the work is accompleshed using a multi-objective evolutionary technique. Results have been demonstrated for both artificial and real-life gene expression data sets.",

It becomes possible to perform conventionally impossible tasks by human alone or robot alone, because the system synergizes better assets of both parties. In this paper, the concept of Man- Machine Synergy Effector is described. Then, the Power Pedal is introduced as a prototype of Man-Machine Synergy Effector for human lower extremities, which amplifies human leg power intuitively. I. INTRODUCTION",

        "abstract":"We perform an empirical study of the preferential attachment phenomenon in temporal networks and show that on the Web, networks follow a nonlinear preferential attachment model in which the exponent depends on the type of network considered. The classical preferential attachment model for networks by Barab\u00e1si and Albert (1999) assumes a linear relationship between the number of neighbors of a node in a network and the probability of attachment. Although this assumption is widely made in Web Science and related fields, the underlying linearity is rarely measured. To fill this gap, this paper performs an empirical longitudinal (time-based) study on forty-seven diverse Web network datasets from seven network categories and including directed, undirected and bipartite networks. We show that contrary to the usual assumption, preferential attachment is nonlinear in the networks under consideration. Furthermore, we observe that the deviation from linearity is dependent on the type of network, giving sublinear attachment in certain types of networks, and superlinear attachment in others. Thus, we introduce the preferential attachment exponent \u03b2 as a novel numerical network measure that can be used to discriminate different types of networks. We propose explanations for the behavior of that network measure, based on the mechanisms that underly the growth of the network in question.",

        "abstract":"The performance of page replacement algorithms used by the virtual memory management system and file system of operating systems is important because of the higher disk access latency. The situation complicates further under the limitation of memory. There exists a set of page replacement algorithms, however, a majority of them are based on static policies. In this paper, a novel Fuzzy Adaptive Page Replacement algorithm (FAPR) is proposed. The FAPR algorithm applies fuzzy inference technique based on an adaptive rule-base and online priority control. The algorithm is simulated in a highly memory-constrained environment under various load distributions. The results demonstrate that the FAPR algorithm enhances the performance in comparison to the commonly used algorithms such as, LRU and LFU. In the worst-case execution model, FAPR algorithm averages the performance of the LRU and LFU algorithms. This paper describes the design and simulation of the FAPR algorithm along with the results.",

        "abstract":"This paper introduces a new measure of confusion between phones, based on isolated word recognition tests. This metric combines the advantages of previous measures, and excludes their disadvantages. It can be used for comparing the performance of two speech rec- ognizers at phone level, providing a useful design tool. The main advantage is that tests are made on any set of recorded words, but measure of confusion is evaluated for a particular phone versus an- other one, and at the same time it is vocabulary independent. Note that manual phone segmentation is not needed. Furthermore, a suit- able combination of several tests allows to obtain useful statistical paired tests. The advantages of this new method are illustrated on the basis of both artificial examples and comparisons between real ASR systems.",

        "abstract":"UW Medicine teaching hospitals have seen a move from paper to electronic physician inpatient notes, after improving the availability of workstations, and wireless laptops and the technical infrastructure supporting the electronic medical record (EMR), The primary driver for the transition was to unify the medical record for all disciplines in one location. The main barrier faced was the time required to enter notes, which was addressed with data-rich templates tailored to rounding workflow, simplified login and other measures. After a 2-year transition, nearly all physician notes for hospitalized patients are now entered electronically, approximately 1500 physician notes per day. Remaining challenges include time for note entry, and the perception that notes may be more difficult to understand and to find within the EMR. In general, the transition from paper to electronic notes has been regarded as valuable to patient care and hospital operations.",

First, measuring results of Internet topology from CAIDA monitors have been used to produce a complete topology sample. With this sample, research approaches of the frequency-degree power-law, degree-rank power-law and CCDF(d)-degree power-law have been studied to outline the network power-law properties. The frequency-degree power-law relationship is found to be with a power exponent f 2.1406. The degree-rank power-law, however, is found to ave two phases of power-law relationships with ower-exponents of 0.29981 and 0.84639 respectively. Then, e improved the raditional BA model to construct an nternet topology model (Improved BA model, IBA model, nd optimized the IBA model in Genetic Algorithm by the ower-exponents gained from frequency-degree power and egree-rank power-law analyses in the paper. Generation lgorithm for the IBA model was given at last \u00a9 2011 academy publisher.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we propose a generalization of the basic flooding search strategy for decentralized unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. In our algorithm a peer forwards a query to one of its neighbors using a probability that is a function of the number of connections in the overlay network of both. Moreover, this probability may also depend on the distance from the query originator. To analyze the performance of the proposed search strategy in heterogeneous decentralized unstructured P2P networks, we develop a generalized random graph (GRG)-based model that takes into account the high variability in the number of application level connections that each peer establishes, and the nonuniform distribution of resources among peers. Furthermore, the model includes an analysis of peer availability, i.e., the capability of relaying queries of other peers, as a function of the query generation rate of each peer. Validation of the proposed model is carried out comparing the model predictions with simulations conducted on real overlay topologies obtained from crawling the popular file sharing application Gnutella.",

        "abstract":"MOTIVATION: It is well known that the accuracy of RNA secondary structure prediction from a single sequence is limited, and thus a comparative approach that predicts a common secondary structure from aligned sequences is a better choice if homologous sequences with reliable alignments are available. However, correct secondary structure information is needed to produce reliable alignments of RNA sequences. To tackle this dilemma, we require a fast and accurate aligner that takes structural information into consideration to yield reliable structural alignments, which are suitable for common secondary structure prediction. RESULTS: We develop DAFS, a novel algorithm that simultaneously aligns and folds RNA sequences based on maximizing expected accuracy of a predicted common secondary structure and its alignment. DAFS decomposes the pairwise structural alignment problem into two independent secondary structure prediction problems and one pairwise (non-structural) alignment problem by the dual decomposition technique, and maintains the consistency of a pairwise structural alignment by imposing penalties on inconsistent base pairs and alignment columns that are iteratively updated. Furthermore, we extend DAFS to consider pseudoknots in RNA structural alignments by integrating IPknot for predicting a pseudoknotted structure. The experiments on publicly available datasets showed that DAFS can produce reliable structural alignments from unaligned sequences in terms of accuracy of common secondary structure prediction.",

        "abstract":"The nearest neighbour (NN) rule is widely used in pattern recognition tasks due to its simplicity and its good behaviour. Many fast NN search algorithms have been developed during last years. However, in some classification tasks an exact NN search is too slow, and a way to quicken the search is required. To face these tasks it is possible to use approximate NN search, which usually increases error rates but highly reduces search time. In this work we propose using approximate NN search with an algorithm suitable for general metric spaces, the Fukunaga and Narendra algorithm, and its application to chromosome recognition. Also, to compensate the increasing in error rates that approximate search produces, we propose to use a recently proposed framework to classify using k neighbours that axe not always the k nearest neighbours. This framework improves NN classification rates without extra time cost.",

        "abstract":"A company regards corporate knowledge shared within an organisation as intellectual capital. Most companies have adopted a new business paradigm, Knowledge Management (KM), and its realisation using computer technologies, Knowledge Management System (KMS). Since KMS has created new business value and requires an organisational culture, it has many different characteristics in contrast to conventional information system. Little research, however, has been conducted to evaluate KMS. In this paper, we suggest a framework for evaluating KMS. Several assessment perspectives and metrics are discussed for more unbiased KMS evaluation using the concept of Balanced Scorecard. Analytic Hierarchy Process is used to consolidate the assessment perspectives and metrics. We anticipate that the proposed framework will be useful in assessing the effectiveness of KMS.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we study the wire sizing and wire spacing problem for post-layout performance optimization under Elmore delay model. Both ground capacitance and coupled capacitance in a wire are included in interconnect delay calculation. Combined with general ASIC design flow, we construct section constraint graph in each routing region and use the graph to guide segment sizing and spacing. By defining a cost function to trade-off between interconnect delay and routing area, we formulate wire sizing and wire spacing problem (WSSP) into a constraint-optimization problem and develop a heuristic algorithm to solve it. The preliminary experiments are promising.",

        "abstract":"Proton transfer (PT) and excited-state PT process are proposed to account for the fluorescent sensing mechanism of a cyanide chemosensor, 8-formyl-7-hydroxycoumarin. The time-dependent density functional theory method has been applied to investigate the ground and the first singlet excited electronic states of this chemosensor as well as its nucleophilic addition product with cyanide, with a view to monitoring their geometries and spectrophotometrical properties. The present theoretical study indicates that phenol proton of the chemosensor transfers to the formyl group along the intramolecular hydrogen bond in the first singlet excited state. Correspondingly, the nucleophilic addition product undergoes a PT process in the ground state, and shows a similar structure in the first singlet excited state. This could explain the observed strong fluorescence upon the addition of the cyanide anion in the relevant fluorescent sensing mechanism. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract":"The GGH family of multivariate distributions is obtained by scale mixing on the Exponential Power distribution using the Extended Generalised Inverse Gaussian distribution. The resulting GGH family encompasses the multivariate generalised hyperbolic (GH), which itself contains the multivariate t and multivariate Variance-Gamma (VG) distributions as special cases. It also contains the generalised multivariate t distribution [O. Arslan, Family of multivariate generalised t distribution, Journal of Multivariate Analysis 89 (2004) 329-337] and a new generalisation of the VG as special cases. Our approach unifies into a single GH-type family the hitherto separately treated t-type [O. Arslan, A new class of multivariate distribution: Scale mixture of Kotz-type distributions, Statistics and Probability Letters 75 (2005) 18-28; O. Arslan, Variance-mean mixture of Kotz-type distributions, Communications in Statistics-Theory and Methods 38 (2009) 272-284] and VG-type cases. The GGH distribution is dual to the distribution obtained by analogous mixing on the scale parameter of a spherically symmetric stable distribution. Duality between the multivariate t and multivariate VG [S.W. Harrar, E. Seneta, A.K. Gupta, Duality between matrix variate t and matrix variate V.G. distributions, Journal of Multivariate Analysis 97 (2006) 1467-1475] does however extend in one sense to their generalisations.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents a new power saving, high speed FPGA design enhancing a previous SiGe CML FPGA based on the Xilinx 6200 FPGA. The design aims at having a higher performance but minimizing power consumption. The new SiGe process has traded off the circuit's performance for reduced power consumption. The power supply voltage has been reduced from 3.4 V to 2.0 V. The structure of the Basic Cell, including the Configurable Logic Block (CLB) and routing multiplexers (MUXs), has been modified so that the supply voltage reduction can be attained. Simulations have shown that the gate delay of the new Basic Cell is reduced from 130 ps in the prior design to 51 ps. The total power consumption for each Basic Cell has been reduced 94% from 71 mW to 4.2 mW, making a large scale FPGA feasible. This design is currently under fabrication for testing.",

The business intelligent model achieves better efficiency in input variables selecting because they are selected and newly created by time series models. Repetitive trial error process could be effectively eliminated to one time series process. On the other hand, the performance of traditional time series models could be further enhanced by the forecasting power of ANN models. Empirical study shows that the business intelligent model can improve the predictive power in the framework of both accuracy and reliability.",

        "abstract":"The call admission control schemes for ATM-type networks are based on the concept of effective bandwidth (EB). Most such schemes focus on the cell loss rate as the exclusive QoS metric and therefore base their EB on cell-loss rate approximations. We use simulation data to develop regression models for cell loss and cell delay; these estimates can be used to compute effective bandwidths to satisfy both cell loss and delay. We compare the accuracy of the regression models with that of the well-known fluid-flow model by Anick et al. Our results indicate that the regression models are computationally simple and sufficiently accurate for practical use.",

        "abstract":"DNA-based circuit design is an area of research in which traditional silicon-based technologies are replaced by naturally occurring phenomena taken from biochemistry and molecular biology. This research focuses on further developing DNA-based methodologies to mimic digital data manipulation. While exhibiting fundamental principles, this work was done in conjunction with the vision that DNA-based circuitry, when the technology matures, will form the basis for a tamper-proof security module, revolutionizing the meaning and concept of tamper-proofing and possibly preventing it altogether based on accurate scientific observations. A paramount part of such a solution would be self-generation of random numbers. A novel prototype schema employs solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotides for random construction of DNA sequences; temporary storage and retrieval is achieved through plasmid vectors. A discussion of how to evaluate sequence randomness is included, as well as how these techniques are applied to a simulation of the random number generation circuitry. Simulation results show generated sequences successfully pass three selected NIST random number generation tests specified for security applications.",

        "abstract":"Emerging uncertain database applications often involve the cleansing (conditioning) of uncertain databases using additional information as new evidence for reducing the uncertainty. However, past researches on conditioning probabilistic databases, unfortunately, only focus on functional dependency. In real world applications, most additional information on uncertain data sets can be acquired in the form of aggregate constraints (e.g., the aggregate results are published online for various statistical purposes). Therefore, if these aggregate constraints can be taken into account, uncertainty in data sets can be largely reduced. However, finding a practical method to exploit aggregate constraints to decrease uncertainty is a very challenging problem. In this paper, we present three approaches to cleanse (condition) uncertain databases by employing aggregate constraints. Because the problem is NP-hard, we focus on the two approximation strategies by modeling the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and then utilizing Simulated Annealing (SA) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to sample from the entire solution space of possible worlds. In order to favor those possible worlds holding higher probabilities and satisfying all the constraints at the same time, we define Satisfaction Degree Functions (SDF) and then construct the objective function accordingly. Subsequently, based on the sample result, we remove duplicates, re-normalize the probabilities of all the qualified possible worlds, and derive the posterior probabilistic database. Our experiments verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms and show that our approximate approaches scale well to large-sized databases.",

        "abstract":"This workshop proposed to bring together researchers interested in visual adaptation of interfaces. The gaze-tracking community is often constrained to visual adaptation at short distances where gaze data is reliably available. Researchers working on distance-based interfaces tend to work in room-sized environments, with wall-sized displays or multiple displays. Visual adaptation using contextual information or personalisation is relatively independent of the size of the environment but comes with its own set of challenges due to the complexities of dealing with contextual information. Even though most of these researchers are creating visually adaptive interfaces, their approaches, concerns and constraints differ. The aim of this workshop was to create an opportunity to increase awareness of the diverse research as well as for establishing areas of possible collaboration.",

In the problem under consideration, secondary networks are infrastructure-based with a cognitive base station. We consider the path loss, the lognormal shadowing, Rayleigh fading channels, and their effects on the transmission power constraint and uplink scheduling. We develop two uplink scheduling algorithms for maximum sum rate (MSR) and proportional fairness (PF). The objective of the MSR algorithm is to maximize the sum rates of all SUs, but this algorithm does not consider the fairness among SUs. In contrast, the PF algorithm considers the fairness among SUs. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show the tradeoff between maximizing the sum rates and achieving fairness.",

It was conjectured that there exists a fixed m such that any two graphs are isomorphic if and only if their m-th symmetric powers are cospectral. In this paper we show that given a positive integer m there exist infinitely many pairs of non-isomorphic graphs with cospectral m-th symmetric powers. Our construction is based on theory of multidimensional extensions of coherent configurations.",

        "abstract":"By using spatial diversity, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar can improve detection performance for fluctuating targets. In this paper, we propose a spatial fluctuation target model for MIMO radar, where targets are classified as non-fluctuating target, Rayleigh target and Rician target. Based on Stein's lemma, we use relative entropy to study detection performance of optimum detector for Rician target. It is found that in low signal noise ratio (SNR) region, the performance improvement of MIMO radar for detecting Rician target depends on array gain, which is related to the number of receivers. In high SNR region, the improvement of performance depends on diversity gain, which is related to the product of the number of receivers and the number of transmitters. The conclusions of this paper are important for designing MIMO radar system.",

        "abstract":"The correct implementation of security protocols is a challenging task. To achieve a high degree of confidence in an implementation, as with any software, ideally one requires both: (i) a formal specification that has been subjected to verification, and (ii) tool support to generate an implementation from the verified specification. The formal specification and verification of security protocols has attracted considerable attention, with corresponding advances. However, the state of the art in the generation of implementations has not progressed beyond relatively simple protocols. This paper presents a case study on the implementation of a deterministically fair non-repudiation protocol. Such protocols are among the most complex of security protocols. Sub-protocols are typically required to guarantee timely termination. A trusted third party must be involved to guarantee fairness. Finally, to satisfy requirements such as non-repudiable audit, significant infrastructure support is needed. The case study demonstrates an improved approach to protocol implementation. Starting with a formal specification, a rigorous process with considerable tool support leads to the deployment of a protocol implementation in a flexible Web services-based execution framework. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the approach.",

        "abstract":"In wireless sensor network (WSN) environments, environmental noises are generated by, for example, small passing animals, crickets chirping or foliage blowing and will interfere target detection if the noises are higher than the sensor threshold value. For accurate tracking by acoustic WSNs, these environmental noises should be filtered out before initiating track. This paper presents the effect of environmental noises on target tracking and proposes a new algorithm for the noise mitigation in acoustic WSNs. We find that our noise mitigation algorithm works well even for targets with sensing range shorter than the sensor separation as well as with longer sensing ranges. It is also found that noise duration at each sensor affects the performance of the algorithm. A detection algorithm is also presented to account for the Doppler effect which is an important consideration for tracking higher-speed ground targets. For tracking, we use the weighted sensor position centroid to represent the target position measurement and use the Kalman filter (KF) for tracking.",

Experimental results show that this approach can effectively prolong node utilization rate and network lifetime.",

We analyzed position-specific amino acid compositions around the order\/disorder boundaries and found more than thirty significant (p < 0.05) compositional differences between boundary and non-boundary data. From this analysis, we constructed several logistic regression predictors of order\/disorder boundaries using slightly different data modeling approaches. Exact boundary prediction accuracies were estimated to be in the range from 74% to 80% for the different predictors.",

        "abstract":"Statistical methods are extensively used by hydrogeologists for assessing groundwater vulnerability. Several of these methods require to express the response variable as binary and to select a threshold distinguishing between positive and negative indicators of contamination that are usually identified as occurrences and non-occurrences, respectively. In this study, both occurrences and non-occurrences were alternately used as training points (TPs) in the weights of evidence (WofE) for assessing groundwater vulnerability to nitrate contamination of a shallow, unconfined, porous aquifer. This was done to better understand the individual role and the combined effect of explanatory variables in both protecting and exposing groundwater from and to nitrate contamination in the study area. The idea behind this approach is that, for a given aquifer, each explanatory variable should have an unequivocal effect on the physical process of groundwater contamination. As part of this study, a procedure for multi-class generalization was developed. Results showed that an evidential theme, even if it appears to be a statistically significant predictor of occurrences, can show an equivocal spatial relationship with the positive and the negative indicators of contamination due to the presence of a sampling bias between the TPs and the evidential theme. It was demonstrated that, if sampling bias is not recognized and corrected, the use of such evidential theme in the analysis could lead to obtain unreliable groundwater vulnerability maps. In order to deal with this issue, a quantitative methodology to correct the effects of sampling bias was successfully tested. Indeed, once the spatial relationships between the different type of TPs and the considered evidential themes were corrected for the effects of sampling bias, the WofE method was found to be a reliable modeling technique for assessing groundwater vulnerability and proved to be capable of identifying areas characterized by different degrees of vulnerability.",

        "abstract":"Microarray gene expression data provide life science researchers with much more sensitive and detailed information about gene expression patterns than conventional methodologies for the purpose of facilitating gene recognition efforts. However, due to insufficient image resolution and noise generated during microarray experiments, gene expression matrices are frequently represented with missing elements. Methods for estimating missing microarray data are therefore needed to allow further analysis. In this paper, we present two kriging estimators for estimating missing values in DNA microarrays. These approaches can be useful for downstream analysis of microarray-based gene expression data.",

        "abstract":"In recent years the emergence of new real-world applications such as network traffic monitoring, intrusion detection systems, sensor network data analysis, click stream mining and dynamic tracing of financial transactions, calls for studying a new kind of model. Named data stream, this model is in fact a continuous and potentially infinite flow of information as opposed to finite and statically stored data sets. We study the problem of sequential pattern mining in data streams. This problem has been extensively studied for the conventional case of disk resident data sets. In the case of data streams, this problem becomes more challenging as the volume of data is usually too huge to be stored on permanent devices, main memory or to be scanned thoroughly more than once. In this case, it may be acceptable to generate approximable solutions for our mining problem. In this paper we introduce a new approach based on biased reservoir sampling to achieve a more efficient mining of sequential patterns. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that our biased reservoir size is always bounded whatever the size of the stream is. This property often allows us to keep the entire relevant reservoir in main memory. We also show a simple algorithm to build the biased reservoir for the special case of sequential pattern mining. Experimental evaluation supports the claim that sequential pattern mining based on biased reservoir sampling needs small memory requirements. Besides, we also propose an adapted approach to handle the case of mining sequential patterns in a sliding window model. The experiment show that the results are accurate.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we present a new approach to generating Event B specification from UML Activity Diagrams (AD). The goal of this work is to define a formal semantics of activity diagrams that is suitable for workflows modelling. The semantics should allow verification of functional requirements using the B powerful support tools like B4free. In important characteristic of workflows is that the workflow systems are reactive systems. In this paper, we present a formal syntax and semantic for UML AD endowed with interactive aspects (send\/receive event concepts), and we illustrate the proposed technique by an example of workflow application.",

Jitter and shimmer features are extracted from the fundamental frequency contour and added to baseline spectral features, specifically Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) for human speech and Greenwood function cepstral coefficients (GFCCs) for animal vocalizations. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) state distributions are used for classification. The appended jitter and shimmer features result in an increase in classification accuracy for several illustrative datasets, including the SUSAS dataset for human speaking styles as well as vocalizations labeled by arousal level for African elephant and Rhesus monkey species.",

        "abstract":"First-episode schizophrenia and chronic schizophrenia have different patterns of cortical gray matter loss, due to differences in the period of illness. Differences in the reduction of cortical thickness between first-episode and chronic schizophrenia has not yet been addressed using a technique of measuring cortical thickness. The goal of this study is to identify differences in cerebral cortical thickness between first-episode schizophrenic patients and matched normal controls as well as between chronic schizophrenic patients and matched normal controls. Thirty-five chronic and 24 first-episode schizophrenic patients were compared with each age- and sex-matched control group, respectively. To measure cortical thickness, we utilized an inner and outer cortical surface reconstruction algorithm. Cortical thickness was directly measured as the distance between the two surfaces. Statistical analysis was performed with diffusion smoothing along cortical manifolds, and surface normalization on a sphere model. There were no significant changes in global mean thickness and cerebral gray matter volume in both first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients. However, we observed regional thinning of cortical thickness, most significantly in the superior temporal gyrus of first-episode schizophrenic patients. In chronic schizophrenia, larger regions including the prefrontal cortex (PF) were significantly thinned compared to the first-episode group. This suggests that the duration of illness affects cortical thinning in the PF, as well as the extent of cortical thinning. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract":"Existing models for cluster analysis typically consist of a number of attributes that describe the objects to be partitioned and one single latent variable that represents the clusters to be identified. When one analyzes data using such a model, one is looking for one way to cluster data that is jointly defined by all the attributes. In other words, one performs unidimensional clustering. This is not always appropriate. For complex data with many attributes, it is more reasonable to consider multidimensional clustering, i.e., to partition data along multiple dimensions. In this paper, we present a method for performing multidimensional clustering on categorical data and show its superiority over unidimensional clustering.",

        "abstract":"This study explores the empirical basis for multimodal conversation control acts. Applying conversation analysis as an exploratory approach, we attempt to illuminate the control functions of paralinguistic behaviors in managing multiparty conversation. We contrast our multiparty analysis with an earlier dyadic analysis and, to the extent permitted by our small samples of the corpus, contrast (a) conversations where the conversants did or did not have an artifact, and (b) conversations in English among Americans with conversations in Spanish among Mexicans. Our analysis suggests that speakers tend not to use gaze shifts to cue nodding for grounding and that the presence of an artifact reduced listeners' gaze at the speaker. These observations remained relatively consistent across the two languages.",

        "abstract":"In this paper I examine mixed synchronous and asynchronous text-based conversations that have been carried on in the context of a computer-mediated communication (CMC) system called \"Babble\", which has been in use by a group of nine-teen people for nearly two years. The primary goal is to explore principled ways of analyzing and characterizing conversational activity in such systems using genre theory. After discussing genre theory, and some of the issues that come to the fore when apply genre theory to CMC, the paper analyzes five conversations. It argues that the conversations constitute separate genres, and develops the concept of participatory structure to capture some of their differences. Next, the paper examines the CMC system as a whole: it argues that the CMC system may be viewed as an ecology of conversational genres, and discusses three properties - global pull, topical pull, and conversational impetus - which may be used to characterize the behavior of the ecology.",

        "abstract":"Interactive document composition requires users to launch complex programs, interleaving editing, integration, and formatting activities. Moreover, access to the document fragments may require specialised programs, possibly using proprietary formats. We propose a light-weight interaction framework for document composition, based on a notion of resource, where document construction amounts to selecting fragments, possibly generated via simple in-place editors or extracted from existing rich format documents. Actual document generation uses style sheets to produce different renderings for the same content.",

        "abstract":"The detection of a known broadband signal in colored noise of unknown power spectral density is addressed. Motivated by the consistency of the integrated periodogram, a new detector is proposed. Its asymptotic performance is proven to be only slightly poorer than the optimal but unrealizable Neyman-Pearson detector. It also possesses the CFAR property asymptotically and should therefore be quite valuable in practice. For finite data records, it is shown by computer simulation to significantly outperform the conventional matched filter (without prewhitening) under realistic conditions encountered in practice",

All three projects face the same general challenges: massive amounts of raw data, expensive processing steps, and the requirement to make raw data or data products available to users nation- or world-wide. However, there are several differences that prevent a one-sizefits- all approach to handling their data flows. Instead, current implementations are heavily tuned by domain and data management experts. We describe the three projects, and we outline research issues and opportunities to integrate Grid technology into these workflows.",

        "abstract":"We investigated the problem of imprecisely determined prokaryotic transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TFBSs). We found that the identification and reinvestigation of questionable binding motifs may result in improved models of these motifs. Subsequent modelbased predictions of gene regulatory interactions may be performed with increased accuracy when the TFBSs annotation underlying these models has been re-adjusted. We present MoRAine 2.0, a significantly improved version of MoRAine. It can automatically identify cases of unfavorable TFBS strand annotations and imprecisely determined TFBS positions. With release 2.0, we close the gap between reasonable running time and high accuracy. Furthermore, it requires only minimal input from the user: (1) the input TFBS sequences and (2) the length of the flanking sequences.MoRAine 2.0 is an easy-to-use, integrated, and publicly available web tool for the re-annotation of questionable TFBSs. It can be used online or downloaded as a stand-alone version from http:\/\/moraine.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de.",

        "abstract":"For automatic target recognition, a neural network is desired that minimizes the number of misclassifications with the minimum network complexity. Minimizing network complexity is important for both improving generalization and simplifying implementation. The least mean squares (LMS) energy function used in standard back propagation does not always produce such a network. Therefore, two minimum misclassification error (MME) energy functions are advanced to achieve this. Examples are given in which LMS requires five times as many hidden units in a multilayer perceptron to achieve test set classification accuracy similar to that achieved with the MME functions. Examples are given to provide insight into the nature of the LMS performance, namely that LMS approximates the a posteriori probabilities and class boundaries emerge indirectly from this process. The examples also show that the MME functions tend to find local minima less often than LMS does for the same number of hidden units. This is believed to be due to the difference in network complexity needed to accurately approximate a posteriori probabilities versus class boundaries.",

        "abstract":"Background: Vascular risk factors are often poorly managed. A multifactor approach with the aid of nurse practitioners (NPs) is more beneficial for achieving treatment goals of risk factors than achieved with usual care in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Objective: In the SPAIN pilotstudy, we want to implement and test a secure personalized website with additional treatment and coaching of a NP for risk factors in patients with CVD. Fifty patients are going to use the patient-specific website for six months. At study begin; realistic treatment goal(s) for elevated risk factors are made between patients and the NP. Patients can enter new measurements and are stimulated to keep regular e-mail contact. The NP personally replies during working days and gives regular but protocol driven feedback and support. Data will be collected on login attempts, amount of messages, risk factor levels before and after intervention and on beliefs. Determinants of changing behaviour are collected. Results: The results can be expected at the beginning of 2007. Conclusion: This pilot-study will give insight in feasibility and satisfaction of patients and NP in electronically treatment of risk factors. Also information on the course of risk factors will be available.",

        "abstract":"This paper focuses on multilayer perceptron neural networks where the activation functions are adaptive and where each neu- ron synapse is modelled by a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. A simplified architecture consisting of a variable activation (VA) function which is sandwiched between two FIR synapses is stud- ied. The VA function consists of a mixed linear-tanh sigmoid with a parameter which controls the linear region.The VA parameters and FIR synaptic weights are updated using a modified form of the instantaneous-cost (IC) temporal backpropagation algorithm (1). Simulations for identifying cascaded nonlinear transfer func- tions with internal memory and arbitrary activation functions illustrate the improved modelling performance over models with non-adaptive activation functions.",

        "abstract":"A new semi-automatic method for segmenting the spinal cord from MR images is presented. The method is based on an active surface (AS) model of the cord surface, with intrinsic smoothness constraints. The model is initialized by the user marking the approximate cord center-line on a few representative slices, and the compact surface parametrization results in a rapid segmentation, taking on the order of 1 min. Using 3-D acquired T1-weighted images of the cervical spine from human controls and patients with multiple sclerosis, the intra- and inter-observer reproducibilities were evaluated, and compared favorably with an existing cord segmentation method. While the AS method overestimated the cord area by approximately 14% compared to manual outlining, correlations between cord cross-sectional area and clinical disability scores confirmed the relevance of the new method in measuring cord atrophy in multiple sclerosis. Segmentation of the cord from 2-D multi-slice T2-weighted images is also demonstrated over the cervical and thoracic region. Since the cord center-line is an intrinsic parameter extracted as part of the segmentation process, the image can be resampled such that the center-line forms one coordinate axis of a new image, allowing simple visualization of the cord structure and pathology; this could find wider application in standard radiological practice.",

        "abstract":"Environmental planners take advantage of Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) to deal with data and models for problem solving. However, these kinds of software usually provide generic models, which require considerable effort to be specialized to fit particular situations. This paper explores a solution which couples Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to an existing SDSS, named WOODSS, to help planners to profit from others' experiences. WOODSS is based on a Geographic Information System, and interactively documents planners' modeling activities by means of scientific workflows, that are stored in a database. This paper describes how CBR has been used as part of WOODSS' retrieval and storage mechanisms, to identify similar models to reuse in new decision processes. This adds a new dimension to the functionality of available SDSS.",

        "abstract":"Although several casual gaming systems have been developed during the past years, little research examining the impact of human factors on the design and use of digital games has been carried out, and commercially available games are only partially suitable for audiences with special needs. The research project described within this paper aims to analyze and explore design guidelines for diverse audiences and results of focus group gaming sessions to develop a research toolbox allowing for the easy creation of adaptable and accessible game scenarios. Thereby, a controllable environment for the detailed evaluation of the interrelations between human factors and entertainment systems is provided. Results obtained by further testing will be integrated in the toolbox, and may foster the development of accessible games, thus opening up new opportunities for diverse audiences and allowing them to further engage in digital games.",

In many such learning systems, the input space is partitioned by the sys- tem designer. However, input-space partitioning could be learned. Our objective is to compare learned and fixed input-space partitionings in terms of the overall system learning speed and proficiency achieved. We present a sys- tem for unsupervised control-learning in temporal domains with results for both fixed and learned input-space parti- tionings. The trailer-backing task is used as an example problem.",

        "abstract":"The information technology (IT) field is perhaps one of the most dynamic professions in modern history. Rapid advances in technology, along with dynamic nature of IT content have placed colleges and universities in a major predicament relative to procuring needed equipment and maintaining currency. On one hand, there is an increased need for trained IT professionals with current skills; on the other hand there is a major threat as academic institution are unable to meet the market demands due to limitation of available resources. Our solution to this challenge was to create an avenue for institutions to share resources in very innovative and mutually beneficial ways. In the wake of budget cuts and shrinking resources, our solution will ultimately allow schools to capitalize on the technologies available at each institution by pooling them into a large network of heterogeneous facilities that can be accessed over the Internet. A key feature of this process is the fact that everything is handled automatically by our locally developed in-house solution, thus freeing instructors of the burden of trying to locate needed resources for their student.",

Further, we give an example of a groupoid such that \u03c9 ( G ) is in the smallest variety outside of DA , and which recognizes all context-free languages not containing the empty word.",

        "abstract":"Simple photoreceptors without microvilli or cilia, the photorescponsive neurons, designated as A-P-1, Es-1, Ip-2, and Ip-1, exist in the abdominal ganglion of sea slug Onchidium. Of these, A-P-1 and Es-1 respond to light with a depolarizing receptor potential, caused by the closing of light-dependent, cGMP-gated K+ channels, whereas Ip-2 and Ip-1 are hyperpolarized by light, owing to the opening of the same K+ channels. Studies show the first demonstration of a new type of cGMP cascade, in which Ip-2 and Ip-1 cells are hyperpolarized when light activates GC through a Go-type G-protein. This new cascade thus contrasts with the well-known phototransduction cGMP cascade mediated by a Gt-type G-protein, seen in rods and cones as well as A-P-1 and Es-1 cells. Studies also suggest that the Onchidium simple photoreceptors and vertebrate simple photoreceptors, called ipRGCs, might be different from the conventional eye photoreceptors, which function as the pattern vision system and that they may be involved in a new sensory modality, the non-visual photoreceptive system, which functions as encoding of ambient light intensities, instead of spatial and temporal resolution. Finally, it is suggested that the Onchidium simple photoreceptors operate in the general regulation by light and dark of synaptic transmission of sensory inputs and subsequent behavioral responses.",

        "abstract":"Low-power three-dimensional (3-D) graphics rendering engine with lighting acceleration is designed and implemented for handheld multimedia terminals. The lighting unit is hardware implemented and integrated into the chip for the low-power acceleration of the 3D graphics applications. We adopt the following three steps to handle the memory bandwidth problem for rendering operations. I) We find bilinear MIPMAP is the best texture filtering algorithm for handheld systems based on our developed energy-efficiency metric. With this observation, we adopt bilinear MIPMAP for our texture filtering unit, which requires only 50% of texture memory bandwidth compared with trilinear MIPMAP filtering. II) We put the depth test operation into the earlier stage of the graphics pipeline, which eliminates texture memory accesses for invisible pixels. III) We develop a power-efficient small cache system as the interface to rendering memory. The accelerator takes 181 K gates and the performance reaches 20 Mpixels\/s. A test chip is implemented with 1-poly 6-metal 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology. It operates at the frequency of 20 MHz with 14.7 mW power consumption.",

The mechanism segments motion data based on stable anchor-points captured by the maxima in spatio-temporal curvature and filtered by posterior attack model. For each segment, we make a randomized cluster division of 3D points based on a secret key. A watermark is then embedded within these clusters by Triangle Orthocenter based encoding approach. Experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme is robust against many possible attacks such as uniform affine transforms (scaling, rotation and translation), noise addition, reordering and cropping.",

        "abstract":"Using traditional semantic data modeling, multi-level modeling can be achieved by representing objects in different abstraction hierarchies, namely classification, aggregation and generalization. This, however, leads to accidental complexity, complicating maintenance and extension. Several modeling techniques, like deep instantiation, powertypes and materialization, have been proposed to reduce unnecessary complexity in modeling objects at multiple levels. Multilevel objects (m-objects) and multi-level relationships (m-relationships) build on these results and provide a natural, intuitive representation of the concretization of objects and relationships along multiple levels of abstraction. By integrating aspects of the different abstraction hierarchies in a single concretization hierarchy, they improve readability and simplify maintenance and extension as compared to previous approaches. The discussion on conceptual modeling is complemented by a brief presentation of M-SQL, a data manipulation and query language for working with m-objects and m-relationships in an object-relational setting.",

In this invited, expository paper, we start by considering the exterior algebra, and the computation of Gr\u00f6bner bases. We then present, in an elementary manner, the explicit form of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand relationship between graded modules over the polynomial ring and complexes over the exterior algebra, that Eisenbud, Fl\u00f8ystad and Schreyer found. We present two applications of these techniques: cohomology of sheaves, and the construction of determinantal formulae for (powers of) Macaulay resultants. We show how to use Macaulay 2 to perform these computations.",

        "abstract":"The joint angle-frequency estimation (JAFE) based on the multidimensional ESPRIT is recently developed high-resolution parameter estimation technique for determining the directions of arrival (DOAs) and center frequencies of a number of narrow-band sources in a band of interest impinging on the far field of a planar array. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient joint angle-frequency estimation method via the unitary transformation, named as Unitary-JAFE algorithm. In the final stage of Unitary-JAFE, the matrix required to eigendecomposition is a complex unsymmetric matrix. For the eigendecomposition of a complex unsymmetric matrix, we will develop an effective algorithm based on Frame method and Newton iteration method, referred as Frame-Newton algorithm. The proposed method offers a number of advantages over other recently proposed ESPRIT-based techniques by taking advantage of the temporal smoothing, spatial smoothing, and forward-backward averaging techniques. Firstly, except for the final eigenvalue decomposition of dimension equal to the number of sources, it is efficiently formulated in terms of real-valued computation throughout. Secondly, in the final stage of the proposed algorithm, the real and imaginary parts of the i th eigenvalue of a matrix are one-to-one related to the frequency and direction of arrival (DOA) of the i th source. That is, the pairing of the estimated frequency and DOA is automatically determined. Thirdly, the proposed method avoids the joint diagonalization processing, which reduces the computation complexity. Finally, simulation results are presented verifying the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract":"Distributed deadlock detection requires identifying the presence of certain properties in the global state of distributed systems. Distributed deadlock detection is complicated due to the lack of both global memory and a common physical clock, and due to unpredictable message delays. We characterize the formation and detection of distributed deadlocks in terms of the contents of local memory of distributed nodes\/sites. We describe how the interaction between deadlock detection and deadlock resolution can lead to the detection of false deadlocks that are impossible to avoid due to inherent system limitations. We define shadow, phantom, and pseudo deadlocks in the proposed framework. We give examples of existing incorrect deadlock detection algorithms to illustrate how they violate the developed requirements for distributed deadlock detection. The characterization provides an insight into the properties of distributed deadlocks, expresses inherent limitations of distributed deadlock detection, and yields new correctness criteria for distributed deadlock detection algorithms.",

        "abstract":"Recent studies have found that overexpression of the High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein, in conjunction with its receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs) and toll-like receptors (TLRs), is associated with proliferation of various cancer types, including that of the breast and pancreatic.We have developed a rule-based model of crosstalk between the HMGB1 signaling pathway and other key cancer signaling pathways. The model has been simulated using both ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and discrete stochastic simulation. We have applied an automated verification technique, Statistical Model Checking, to validate interesting temporal properties of our model.Our simulations show that, if HMGB1 is overexpressed, then the oncoproteins CyclinD\/E, which regulate cell proliferation, are overexpressed, while tumor suppressor proteins that regulate cell apoptosis (programmed cell death), such as p53, are repressed. Discrete, stochastic simulations show that p53 and MDM2 oscillations continue even after 10 hours, as observed by experiments. This property is not exhibited by the deterministic ODE simulation, for the chosen parameters. Moreover, the models also predict that mutations of RAS, ARF and P21 in the context of HMGB1 signaling can influence the cancer cell's fate - apoptosis or survival - through the crosstalk of different pathways.",

        "abstract":"Range images (depth maps) are seeing increased usage in a variety of application areas including entertainment, industrial automation, inspection, remote sensing, and military tactical planning. As the corpus of range imagery increases in size and the need to communicate such images over fixed-bandwidth channels increases, the compression of range data deservesinvestigation. Since the geometry encoded by range sensors is inherently \"low-bandwidth\", transform-based techniques seem appropriate for investigation in this context. This paper reports on experiments with a popular zerotree-based image codec (the SPIHT algorithm developed by Said and Pearlman) and its application to the compression of range imagery. Experiments suggest that compression rates of 1 bit\/pixel and below are achievable with minimal impact on fidelity.",

        "abstract":"Energy consumption is an important issue in the design and use of networks. In this paper, we explore energy savings in networks via a rate adaptation model. This model can be represented by a cost-minimization network routing problem with discrete cost functions. We formulate this problem as an integer program, which is proved to be NP-hard. Then a constant approximation algorithm is developed. In our proposed method, we first transform the program into a continuous-cost network routing problem, and then we approximate the optimal solution by a two-step rounding process. We show by analysis that, for uniform demands, our method provides a constant approximation for the uniform network routing problem with discrete costs. A bicriteria network routing problem is also developed so that a trade-off can be made between energy consumption and network delay. Analytical results for this latter model are also presented.",

        "abstract":"Extending the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma for graphs, P. Frankl and V. Rodl (14) established a 3-graph Regularity Lemma guaranteeing that all large triple systems Gn admit bounded partitions of their edge sets, most classes of which consist of regularly distributed triples. Many applications of this lemma require a companion Counting Lemma (30), allowing one to find and enumerate subhypergraphs of a given isomorphism type in a \"dense and regu- lar\" environment created by the 3-graph Regularity Lemma. Combined applications of these lemmas are known as the 3-graph Regularity Method. In this paper, we provide an algorithmic version of the 3-graph Regularity Lemma which, as we show, is compatible with a Counting Lemma. We also discuss some applications.",

        "abstract":"A new dynamics algorithm for articulated solid animation is presented. It provides enhancements of computational efficiency and accuracy control with respect to previous solutions. Iterative refinement allows us to perform interactive animations which could be only computed off-line using previous methods. The efficiency results from managing two sets of constraints associated with the kinematic graph, and proceeding in two steps. First, the acyclic constraints are solved in linear time. An iterative process then reduces the closed loop errors while maintaining the acyclic constraints. This allows the user to efficiently trade off accuracy for computation time. We analyze the complexity and investigate practical efficiency compared with other approaches. In contrast with previous research, we present a single method which is computationally efficient for acyclic bodies as well as for mesh-like bodies. The accuracy control is provided by the iterative improvement performed by the algorithm and also from the existence of two constraint priority levels induced by the method. Used in conjunction with a robust integration scheme, this new algorithm allows the interactive animation of scenes containing a few thousand geometric constraints, including closed loops. It has been successfully applied to real-time simulations.",

In this paper, we introduce Garnet, a novel visual interface for interaction between humans and Digital Libraries. Garnet provides a visual workspace in which the user can structure and organize documents of interest. This structure is then used to organize and filter further documents which may be of interest, such as search results. Spatial hypertexts are introduced as a framework for creating DL interfaces, and Garnet is compared to existing DL and Spatial Hypertext systems.",

        "abstract":"A new control method called \u201cfully digital voltage-mode control based on predictive hysteresis method\u201d (FDVC-PH) for DC-DC converters was developed. FDVC-PH achieves low output ripple voltage by canceling the delay time caused by a digital control system. Moreover, to cancel the delay time completely, a technique for determining the required predictive time by analyzing predictive operation in frequency domain is proposed. To verify the effectiveness of FDVC-PH, a buck converter was experimentally implemented on a DSP microprocessor. The output ripple voltage of the converter is reduced by 68% with FDVC-PH compared to that with a non-predictive hysteresis method. Moreover, the power consumption of a digital control system using FDVC-PH is reduced by 23% compared to that of a system using conventional digital current-mode control.",

        "abstract":"An effective design of multistage parallel interference cancellation (PIC) receiver using blind adaptive (BA) despreader and pre-respreader interference estimator for uplink CDMA is proposed and analysed. A novel algorithm is designed, which exploits constant modulus (CM) property of the users' transmitted signals and inherent channel condition to perform adaptive despreading based on minimum error variance criteria. This is carried out by BA weighting of each chip signal for accurate tracking of the desired user's signal power and hence for more improved data detection at the output of each stage of PIC. Furthermore, the despreader weights are used within the adaptive pre-respreader interference estimation and cancellation to obtain online scaling factors during every symbol period, without any knowledge of users' channels or the use of training sequences. It is found that this way of estimation is optimal in minimum mean squared error sense, and hence, significant reduction in interference and noise variance is observed in detection and estimation of the desired users' signals compared with conventional PIC. Bit error probability of the proposed PIC is obtained using Gaussian Approximation method. Extensive simulation results are shown, which demonstrate impressive performance advantage in fading environments, high system loading, and severe near far conditions.

For each resulting class sub-types are identified, according to the structure of the knowledge base, which indicate what information may be supporting the misconception and therefore what information to include in the response. Such a characterization, along with a model of what the user knows, enables the system to reason in a domain-independent way about how best to correct the user.",

        "abstract":"The continuous increase of social robots is leading quickly to the cohabitation of humans and social robots at homes. The main way of interaction in these robots is based on verbal communication. Usually social robots are endowed with microphones to receive the voice signal of the people they interact with. However, due to the principle the microphones are based on, they receive all kind of non verbal signals too. Therefore, it is crucial to differentiate whether the received signal is voice or not. In this work, we present a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system to manage this problem. In order to achieve it, the audio signal captured by the robot is analyzed on-line and several characteristics, or statistics, are extracted. The statistics belong to three different domains: the time, the frequency, and the time-frequency. The combination of these statistics results in a robust VAD system that, by means of the microphones located in a robot, is able to detect when a person starts to talk and when he ends. Finally, several experiments are conducted to test the performance of the system. These experiments show a high percentage of success in the classification of different audio signal as voice or unvoice.",

        "abstract":"The basic idea of the geometric approach to learning a Bayesian network (BN) structure is to represent every BN structure by a certain vector. If the vector representative is chosen properly, it allows one to re-formulate the task of finding the global maximum of a score over BN structures as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Such a suitable zero-one vector representative is the characteristic imset, introduced by Studeny, Hemmecke and Lindner in 2010, in the proceedings of the 5th PGM workshop. In this paper, extensions of characteristic imsets are considered which additionally encode chain graphs without flags equivalent to acyclic directed graphs. The main contribution is a polyhedral description of the respective domain of the ILP problem, that is, by means of a set of linear inequalities. This theoretical result opens the way to the application of ILP software packages. The advantage of our approach is that, as a by-product of the ILP optimization procedure, one may get the essential graph, which is a traditional graphical BN representative. We also describe some computational experiments based on this idea.",

        "abstract":"In this paper we have reviewed several types of integrated AC-to-DC converters which have been widely used for inductively-powered applications. The limitations for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in each AC-to-DC converter have been considered in order to design highly power-efficient converters for applications that are in need of higher power levels with very low heat dissipation, such as implantable microelectronic devices (IMD). In this paper, we also propose a fully integrated active voltage doubler with offset-controlled high speed comparators, which provides much lower dropout voltage and far better PCE at high frequency (HF) range compared to its passive counterparts. Our active voltage doubler was fabricated in a 0.5-\u03bcm 3M2P standard CMOS process, occupying 0.144 mm2 of chip area. With 1.72 V peak AC input at 13.56 MHz, the active voltage doubler provides 2.4 V DC output across the 1 k\u03a9 load, achieving high PCE of 78%.",

        "abstract":"Few years old children lift and manipulate unfamiliar objects more dexterously than today's robots. Therefore, it has arisen an interest at the artificial intelligence community to look for inspiration on neurophysiological studies to design better models for the robots. In a human dexterous manipulation a crucial event is the detection of incipient slips. Humans detect the incipient slips based on the responses of their tactile mechanoreceptors. In this paper, we propose a method to detect the incipient slips using artificial neural networks that receive as input simulated human afferent responses. This method is strongly inspired on neurophysiological studies of the afferent responses during the human dexterous manipulation. Finite element analysis was used to model two fingers and an object, and simulated experiments using the proposed method were done. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that simulated human afferent signals are combined with finite element analysis and artificial neural networks, to detect the incipient slips.",

The results show a significant improvement over the standard method.",

        "abstract":"A novel sampling approach to global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of modeling results utilizing concepts from agent-based modeling is presented (Agent-Based Analysis of Global Uncertainty and Sensitivity (ABAGUS)). A plausible model parameter space is discretized and sampled by a particle swarm where the particle locations represent unique model parameter sets. Particle locations are optimized based on a model-performance metric using a standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Locations producing a performance metric below a specified threshold are collected. In subsequent visits to the location, a modified value of the performance metric, proportionally increased above the acceptable threshold (i.e., convexities in the response surface become concavities), is provided to the PSO algorithm. As a result, the methodology promotes a global exploration of a plausible parameter space, and discourages, but does not prevent, reinvestigation of previously explored regions. This effectively alters the strategy of the PSO algorithm from optimization to a sampling approach providing global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. The viability of the approach is demonstrated on 2D Griewank and Rosenbrock functions. This also demonstrates the set-based approach of ABAGUS as opposed to distribution-based approaches. The practical application of the approach is demonstrated on a 3D synthetic contaminant transport case study. The evaluation of global parametric uncertainty using ABAGUS is demonstrated on model parameters defining the source location and transverse\/longitudinal dispersivities. The evaluation of predictive uncertainties using ABAGUS is demonstrated for contaminant concentrations at proposed monitoring wells.",

        "abstract":"Cheap passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags operating in ultra high frequency (UHF) bands are fostering innovation in several field such as building access control, goods tracking, supply chains management and automatic product checkout. RFID transponders can also be coupled to tiny sensors, enabling non invasive monitoring of environmental and personal parameters. To ensure the privacy of highly sensitive data, encryption and authentication capabilities should be embedded in RFID devices, in a fashion compatible with tight power budgets of wireless devices. In this contribution, a baseband-processor is introduced, which complies with ISO 18000-6C (EPC Class1 Gen2) protocol and integrates AES primitives aimed at secure data transmission. Performance of passive RFID devices is limited by the available power, harvested from the incoming radiation. Power-saving strategies are devised, both at the system and the circuit levels. A set of standard cells has been designed, suitable for near-threshold voltage operations. Physical implementation on CMOS 0.18um technology has been carried out and the chip has being fabricated.",

        "abstract":"The paper presents a combination of interactive and automatic tools in the area of software verification. We have integrated a newly developed software model checker into an interactive verification environment for imperative programming languages. Although the problems in software verification are mostly too hard for full automation, we could increase the level of automated assistance by discharging less interesting side conditions. That allows the verification engineer to focus on the abstract algorithm, safely assuming unbounded arithmetic and unlimited buffers.",

We first show that such a language belongs to the Boolean algebra generated by the modular products of elementary commutative languages. An elementary commutative language is defined by a condition specifying the number of occurrences of each letter in its words, modulo some fixed integer. Our second characterization makes use of counting functions computed by transducers in strict triangular form.",

        "abstract":"  This paper considers methods for audio display in a CAVE-type virtual reality theater, a 3 m cube with displays covering all six rigid faces. Headphones are possible since the user's headgear continuously measures ear positions, but loudspeakers are preferable since they enhance the sense of total immersion. The proposed solution consists of open-loop acoustic point control. The transfer function, a matrix of room frequency responses from the loudspeakers to the ears of the user, is inverted using multi-channel inversion methods, to create exactly the desired sound field at the user's ears. The inverse transfer function is constructed from impulse responses simulated by the image source method. This technique is validated by measuring a 2x2 matrix transfer function, simulating a transfer function with the same geometry, and filtering the measured transfer function through the inverse of the simulation. Since accuracy of the image source method decreases with time, inversion performance is improved by windowing the simulated response prior to inversion. Parameters of the simulation and inversion are adjusted to minimize residual reverberant energy; the best-case dereverberation ratio is 10 dB. ",

We did not use a diatonic musical scale to obtain a pleasant sound, focusing instead on the spatial relationship between aminoacids closely placed in the 3- dimensional protein folding.

        "abstract":"Digital artifacts have the potential for augmenting the interest of students and the quality of learning environments. However, it is still common to find technology being inserted in learning settings without a closer connection to the learners' contemporary world. In this paper we report on results of a qualitative research conducted to address questions such as: How could a new technology be introduced in schools in a way that it makes sense to the users? Could it contribute to more integrated learning scenarios? The study took place at an elementary public school in the city of Campinas, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and involved more than 500 people. Data were collected from participatory Workshops, informal interviews and pictographic questionnaire. The results suggest that it is possible to combine school's formal and informal practices into meaningful learning by using the XO educational laptop. The activities helped teachers and students realize that the use of technology can be recreated, influenced by their own feelings, values and culture. A discussion is conducted towards new perspectives on understanding learning practices mediated by technology and the role of the concept of 'Affectibility' in the design of educational systems.",

        "abstract":"In the last few years cooperative systems have gained importance due to the fact that more and more people have access to networked computers. The technical, social and business impacts of using cooperative applications are researched but there are still uncertainties on how computers should ideally support cooperative work. This paper suggests a methodology for the development of cooperative applications. As one very important question for developers of cooperative applications is how users interact with each other and with the application the methodology focuses on multiuser interactions. Multiuser interaction are interactions where multiple users work together in order to trigger the interaction or where users get feedback when the interaction is triggered by another user. A special model for multiuser interactions, MoMI, is introduced and its implementation discussed. The last part of the paper describes experiences in the development of a cooperative application using our methodology.",

        "abstract":"Previous research has found that information technology (IT) investment is associated with significant productivity gains for developed countries but not for developing countries. Yet developing countries have continued to increase their investment in IT rapidly. Given this apparent disconnect, there is a need for new research to study whether the investment has begun to pay off in greater productivity for developing countries. We analyze new data on IT investment and productivity for 45 countries from 1994 to 2007, and compare the results with earlier research. We find that upper-income developing countries have achieved positive and significant productivity gains from IT investment in the more recent period as they have increased their IT capital stocks and gained experience with the use of IT. We also find that the productivity effects of IT are moderated by country factors, including human resources, openness to foreign investment, and the quality and cost of the telecommunications infrastructure. The academic implication is that the effect of IT on productivity is expanding from the richest countries into a large group of developing countries. The policy implication is that lower-tier developing countries can also expect productivity gains from IT investments, particularly through policies that support IT use, such as greater openness to foreign investment, increased investment in tertiary education, and reduced telecommunications costs.",

        "abstract":"This paper considers a joint antenna selection method in amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks where the source, relay and destination terminals are all equipped with multiple antennas. The fact that the system's full diversity can be maintained by antenna selection at each terminal makes it a promising solution to reduce the hardware complexity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terminals while realizing the diversity benefits of MIMO in relay networks. Since the exhaustive search for antenna subset selection is computationally prohibitive, we devise a low-complexity near-optimal joint antenna selection algorithm based on a constrained cross entropy optimization (CCEO) method to maximize the achievable rate and the convergence is guaranteed. Simulation results reveal both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and the significant performance improvement over other benchmark selection techniques. Finally, it is illustrated that the proposed CCEO algorithm can always achieve near-optimal results regardless of the number of selected antennas, outage probabilities and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the terminals.",

        "abstract":"As the key technique to build domain-specific search engines, focused crawling has drawn a lot of attention from researchers in the past decade. However, as Web structure analysis techniques advance, several problems in traditional focused crawler design were revealed and they could result in domain-specific collections with low quality. In this work, we studied the problems of focused crawling that are caused by using local search algorithms. We also proposed to use a global search algorithm, the Genetic Algorithm, in focused crawling to address the problems. We conducted evaluation experiments to examine the effectiveness of our approach. The results showed that our approach could build domain-specific collections with higher quality than traditional focused crawling techniques. Furthermore, we used the concept of Web communities to evaluate how comprehensively the focused crawlers could traverse the Web search space, which could be a good complement to the traditional focused crawler evaluation methods.",

        "abstract":"Template matching is a technique widely used for finding patterns in digital images. A good template matching should be able to detect template instances that have undergone geometric transformations. In this paper, we proposed a grayscale template matching algorithm named Ciratefi, invariant to rotation, scale, translation, brightness and contrast and its extension to color images. We introduce CSSIM (color structural similarity) for comparing the similarity of two color image patches and use it in our algorithm. We also describe a scheme to determine automatically the appropriate parameters of our algorithm and use pyramidal structure to improve the scale invariance. We conducted several experiments to compare grayscale and color Ciratefis with SIFT, C-color-SIFT and EasyMatch algorithms in many different situations. The results attest that grayscale and color Ciratefis are more accurate than the compared algorithms and that color-Ciratefi outperforms grayscale Ciratefi most of the time. However, Ciratefi is slower than the other algorithms.",

        "abstract":"In this work a mathematical model is proposed for modeling of coupled dissolution\/precipitation and transport processes relevant for the study of chalk weakening effects in carbonate reservoirs. The model is composed of a number of convection-diffusion-reaction equations, representing various ions in the water phase, coupled to some stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) representing species in the solid phase. More precisely, the model includes the three minerals CaCO3(calcite), CaSO4(anhydrite), and MgCO3 (magnesite) in the solid phase (i.e., the rock) together with a number of ions contained in the water phase and essential for describing the dissolution\/precipitation processes. Modeling of kinetics is included for the dissolution\/precipitation processes, whereas thermodynamical equilibrium is assumed for the aqueous chemistry. A numerical discretization of the full model is presented. An operator splitting approach is employed where the transport effects (convection and diffusion) and chemical reactions (dissolution\/precipitation) are solved in separate steps. This amounts to switching between solving a system of convection diffusion equations and a system of ODEs. Characteristic features of the model is then explored. In particular, a first evaluation of the model is included where comparison with experimental behavior is made. For that purpose we consider a simplified system where a mixture of water and MgCl2 (magnesium chloride) is injected with a constant rate in a core plug that initially is filled with pure water at a temperature of T = 130 degrees Celsius. The main characteristics of the resulting process, as predicted by the model, is precipitation of MgCO3 and a corresponding dissolution of CaCO3. The injection rate and the molecular diffusion coefficients are chosen in good agreement with the experimental setup, whereas there action rate constants are treated as parameters. In particular, by a suitable choice of reaction rate constants, the model produces results that agree well with experimental profiles for measured ion concentrations at the outlet. Thus, the model seems to offer a sound basis for further systematic investigations of more complicated precipitation\/dissolution processes relevant for increased insight into chalk weakening effects in carbonate reservoirs.",

        "abstract":"Due to the recent development of digital TV broadcasting systems, Near Video-on-Demand (NVoD) systems has attracted a great deal of attention. In general NVoD systems, the server broadcasts the same data repetitively and clients wait until the first portion of the data is broadcast. Although there are many studies on how to reduce the waiting time, these studies assume that there is only one type of clients, and they do not consider cases in which there are many types of clients such as mobile phones, digital video receivers, and so on. In such cases, these methods cannot reduce the waiting time effectively because the available band-widths for clients differ depending on their performances. In this paper, we propose a scheduling method to reduce the waiting time considering heterogeneous clients. Our proposed method further reduces the waiting time by producing an effective broadcast schedule considering the number of clients' available channels.",

        "abstract":"We present human figure control software using vision-based human motion capturing. We have already developed core techniques for vision-based human motion tracking and motion synthesis. We have provided the first version software as an open source kit. In this work, we have developed the second version software with modified motion synthesis. Our software consists of the following software: the vision software (includes 2D blob tracking modules and stereo vision module) and the motion synthesis software (includes skeletal structure reconstruction from a limit number of 3D positions, i.e., physically simulated joint position estimator). This software can be employed for many real-virtual applications such as avatar based video conferencing, virtual human control, and 3D game consoles which need the user postures as input. Our software requires the following hardware: more than two firewire cameras for vision processing and more than one PC for vision processing, motion synthesis, and rendering. In our real-virtual system, this software is also employed for virtual object manipulation interface with augmented avatar representation.",

        "abstract":"A generalized information formula related to logical probability and fuzzy set is deduced from the classical information formula. The new information measure accords with to Popper's criterion for knowledge evolution very much. In comparison with square error criterion, the information criterion does not only reflect error of a proposition, but also reflect the particularity of the events described by the proposition. It gives a proposition with less logical probability higher evaluation. The paper introduces how to select a prediction or sentence from many for forecasts and language translations according to the generalized information criterion. It also introduces the rate fidelity theory, which comes from the improvement of the rate distortion theory in the classical information theory by replacing distortion (i.e. average error) criterion with the generalized mutual information criterion, for data compression and communication efficiency. Some interesting conclusions are obtained from the rate-fidelity function in relation to image communication. It also discusses how to improve Popper's theory.",

        "abstract":"The response of a neuron in the visual cortex to stimuli of different contrast placed in its receptive field is commonly characterized using the contrast response curve. When attention is directed into the receptive field of a V4 neuron, its contrast response curve is shifted to lower contrast values (Reynolds et al., 2000). The neuron will thus be able to respond to weaker stimuli than it responded to without attention. Attention also increases the coherence between neurons responding to the same stimulus (Fries et al., 2001). We studied how the firing rate and synchrony of a densely interconnected cortical network varied with contrast and how they were modulated by attention. The changes in contrast and attention were modeled as changes in driving current to the network neurons. We found that an increased driving current to the excitatory neurons increased the overall firing rate of the network, whereas variation of the driving current to inhibitory neurons modulated the synchrony of the network. We explain the synchrony modulation in terms of a locking phenomenon during which the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory firing rates is approximately constant for a range of driving current values. We explored the hypothesis that contrast is represented primarily as a drive to the excitatory neurons, whereas attention corresponds to a reduction in driving current to the inhibitory neurons. Using this hypothesis, the model reproduces the following experimental observations: (1) the firing rate of the excitatory neurons increases with contrast; (2) for high contrast stimuli, the firing rate saturates and the network synchronizes; (3) attention shifts the contrast response curve to lower contrast values; (4) attention leads to stronger synchronization that starts at a lower value of the contrast compared with the attend-away condition. In addition, it predicts that attention increases the delay between the inhibitory and excitatory synchronous volleys produced by the network, allowing the stimulus to recruit more downstream neurons.",

        "abstract":"The Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is a popular language for architectural modeling and analysis of software intensive systems in application domains such as automotive, avionics, railway and medical systems. These systems often have stringent real-time requirements. This paper presents an extension to AADL's behavior model using time annotations in order to improve the evaluation of timing properties in AADL. The translational semantics of this extension is based on mappings to the Timed Abstract State Machines (TASM) language. As a result, timing analysis with timed simulation or timed model checking is possible. The translation is supported by an Eclipse-based plug-in and the approach is validated with a case study of an industrial production cell system.",

        "abstract":"A noniterative frequency estimator is proposed in this paper. The maximum bin of fast Fourier transform (FFT) is searched as a coarse estimation, then the rational combination of three spectrum lines (RCTSL) is used as the fine estimation. Based on least square approximation in frequency domain, the combinational weights of RCTSL are found to be constants depending only on data length, therefore the RCTSL is very computational efficient. Theoretical bound is also obtained, which shows the performance of RCTSL approaches the Crame\u0301r-Rao Bound (CRB). Simulation results demonstrate that RCTSL has a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold compared with other known estimators.",

        "abstract":"In adverse weather conditions, in particular, in daylight fog, the contrast of images grabbed by in-vehicle cameras in the visible light range is drastically degraded, which makes current driver assistance that relies on cameras very sensitive to weather conditions. An onboard vision system should take weather effects into account. The effects of daylight fog vary across the scene and are exponential with respect to the depth of scene points. Because it is not possible in this context to compute the road scene structure beforehand, contrary to fixed camera surveillance, a new scheme is proposed. Fog density is first estimated and then used to restore the contrast using a flat-world assumption on the segmented free space in front of a moving vehicle. A scene structure is estimated and used to refine the restoration process. Results are presented using sample road scenes under foggy weather and assessed by computing the visibility level enhancement that is gained by the method. Finally, we show applications to the enhancement in daylight fog of low-level algorithms that are used in advanced camera-based driver assistance.",

        "abstract":"Subset selection with a wrapper approach to identify atypical examples can be preferable to a filter approach (which may not be consistent with the classifier in use) but its running time is prohibitive. The fastest available wrappers are quadratic in the number of examples, which is far too expensive for sample subset selection. The presented approach is a linear wrapper method that is roughly 80 times faster than the quadratic wrappers. Atypical points are defined in this paper as the misclassified points that the proposed algorithm (Atypical Sequential Ranking: ASR) finds not useful to the classification task. They may include both outliers and overlapping samples. ASR can identify and rank atypical points in the whole dataset without damaging the prediction accuracy. It is general enough that classifiers without reject option can use it. Experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and 5 classifiers show promising results and confirm that this wrapper method has some advantages and can be used in sample subset selection for atypical detection.",

        "abstract":"Recently we have developed a new method in graph theory based on the Regularity Lemma. The method is applied to find certain spanning subgraphs in dense graphs. The other main general tool of the method, beside the Regularity Lemma, is the so-called Blow-up Lemma ((24)). This lemma helps to find bounded degree spanning subgraphs in \"-regular graphs. Our original proof of the lemma is not algorithmic, it applies probabilistic methods. In this paper we provide an algorithmic version of the Blow-up Lemma. The desired subgraph, for an n-vertex graph, can be found in time O(nM(n)), where M(n) = O(n2.376) is the time needed to multiply two n by n matrices with 0,1 entries over the integers. We show that the algorithm can be parallelized and implemented in NC5.",

        "abstract":"Although multiple biological phenomena are related to temperature (e. g. elevation of body temperature due to an illness, adaptation to environmental temperature conditions, biology of coldblooded versus warm-blooded organisms), the molecular mechanisms of these processes remain to be understood. Perturbations of secondary RNA structures may play an important role in an organism's reaction to temperature change-in all organisms from viruses and bacteria to humans. Here, we present RNAtips (temperature-induced perturbation of structure) web server, which can be used to predict regions of RNA secondary structures that are likely to undergo structural alterations prompted by temperature change. The server can also be used to: (i) detect those regions in two homologous RNA sequences that undergo different structural perturbations due to temperature change and (ii) test whether these differences are specific to the particular nucleotide substitutions distinguishing the sequences. The RNAtips web server is freely accessible without any login requirement at http:\/\/rnatips.org.",

        "abstract":"A hierarchical state machine (Hsm) is a finite state machine where a vertex can either expand to another hierarchical state machine (box) or be a basic vertex (node). Each node is labeled with atomic propositions. We study an extension of such model which allows atomic propositions to label also boxes (Shsm). We show that Shsms can be exponentially more succinct than Shsms and verification is in general harder by an exponential factor. We carefully establish the computational complexity of reachability, cycle detection, and model checking against general Ltl and Ctl specifications. We also discuss some natural and interesting restrictions of the considered problems for which we can prove that Shsms can be verified as much efficiently as Hsms, still preserving an exponential gap of succinctness.",

        "abstract":"Currently in applying IMS LD, a unit of learning has to be completely defined and then it will be executed exactly following the definition. However, many actual learning processes involve uncertainties and dynamical changes. Due to imprecise definition and unexpected run-time events, probably a learning process cannot be executed as planned in the learning design. That is, exceptions may raise and the execution of the normal process model cannot progress. So far the issue of exception handling hasn\u00fdt been seriously addressed in IMS LD community. In this paper the technical requirements for detecting and handling exception are analyzed. Then, the paper presents a proposal enabling learning designers to define exception handling rules by using the same formalisms for modeling normal learning processes.",

        "abstract":"Modeling and abstraction is key in all engineering processes and have found extensive use also in software engineering. When developing new methodologies and techniques to support software engineers we want to evaluate them on realistic models. However, this is a challenge since (1) it is hard to get industry to give access to their models, and (2) we need a large number of models to systematically evaluate a technology. This paper proposes that search-based techniques can be used to search for models with desirable properties, which can then be used to systematically evaluate model-based technologies. By targeting properties seen in industrial models we can then get the best of both worlds: models that are similar to models used in industry but in quantities that allow extensive experimentation. To exemplify our ideas we consider a specific case in which a model generator is used to create models to test a regression test optimization technique.\n\n",

While, the model has many attractive properties, little is actually known about the retrieval effectiveness of the MB model due to its high cost of execution. In this paper, we show how an efficient implementation of this model can be achieved. The resulting method is comparable in terms of efficiency to other standard term matching algorithms (such as the vector space model, BM25 and the multinomial Language Model).",

        "abstract":"  A major stage of radio interferometric data processing is calibration or the estimation of systematic errors in the data and the correction for such errors. A stochastic error (noise) model is assumed, and in most cases, this underlying model is assumed to be Gaussian. However, outliers in the data due to interference or due to errors in the sky model would have adverse effects on processing based on a Gaussian noise model. Most of the shortcomings of calibration such as the loss in flux or coherence, and the appearance of spurious sources, could be attributed to the deviations of the underlying noise model. In this paper, we propose to improve the robustness of calibration by using a noise model based on Student's t distribution. Student's t noise is a special case of Gaussian noise when the variance is unknown. Unlike Gaussian noise model based calibration, traditional least squares minimization would not directly extend to a case when we have a Student's t noise model. Therefore, we use a variant of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, called the Expectation-Conditional Maximization Either (ECME) algorithm when we have a Student's t noise model and use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the maximization step. We give simulation results to show the robustness of the proposed calibration method as opposed to traditional Gaussian noise model based calibration, especially in preserving the flux of weaker sources that are not included in the calibration model.

This can be a severe limitation in applications which require accurate point tracking, e.g., metrology. In this paper, we propose a method for improving the quality of such data without forfeiting the original matches. We formulate the problem as a robust smoothness cost function constrained by a bounded reprojection error. The arising optimization problem is addressed as a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems by virtue of the barrier method. Substantiated experiments on synthetic and acquired data compare our approach to alternative techniques.",

        "abstract":"A polymorphic FIR filter is proposed which can operate in two modes. The first mode is considered as a standard mode in which the filter performs a normal operation. In the second mode, the filter operates with reduced power supply voltage (Vdd), some filter coefficients are reconfigured (as response to the change of the polymorphic gates function which is controlled by Vdd) and some parts of the filter are disconnected. Experimental results indicate that while power consumption can significantly be reduced when half of the taps is suspended the filter is still able to achieve a reasonable quality of filtering.",

        "abstract":"The development of distributed systems is generally regarded as a complex and costly task, and for this reason formal description techniques such as LOTOS and ESTELLE (both standardized by the ISO) are increasingly used in this process. Our experience is that LOTOS can be exploited at many stages on the design trajectory, from requirements specification to implementation, but that the language elements do not allow direct formalization of performance requirements. To avoid duplication of effort by using two formalisms with distinct approaches, we propose a design method that incorporates performance constraints in an heuristic but effective manner.",

        "abstract":"This paper introduces a neuro-fuzzy framework for handling multi-class classification problems. Instead of decomposing such problems into simple sub-problems and solving each part using a different classifier, the proposed system decomposes and implements the entire problem automatically in the same framework. The decomposition is performed using the most commonly used methods for dividing multi-class classification problems: OAA (one-against-all) and OAO (one-against-one). Consequently, two models are introduced: OAA and OAO based neuro-fuzzy classifiers. The design of the proposed models is based on the implementation of each sub-problem using a set of weights. The learning is performed by adjusting every set independently, and without adjusting the parameters of membership functions. This considerably simplifies the classification and learning tasks. After the learning stage, the proposed systems act as a single-module classifier for recognizing new examples.",

        "abstract":"A Knowledge Base (KB) stores, organizes, and shares information pertinent to entities (i.e. KB nodes) such as people, organizations, and events. A large KB system, such as Wikipedia, relies on human curators to create and maintain the content in the systems. However, it has become challenging for human curators to sift through the rapidly growing amount of information and filter out the information irrelevant to a KB node. The area of Knowledge Base Enhancement (KBE) aims to explore and identify automatic methods to assist human curators to accelerate the process. KBE can be viewed as a special case of Information Filtering (IF). However, the lack of high-quality labelled data introduces a major challenge to train a satisfying model for the task. Transfer learning provides solutions to the problem and has explored applications in the area of text mining, whereas direct application to KBE or IF remains absent. Transfer learning is a research area in machine learning, emphasizing the reuse of previously acquired knowledge to another applicable task. The method is particularly useful in the situations where labeled instances are absent or difficult to obtain. To accelerate the growth of a KB, a transfer learning approach enables leveraging the heuristics and models learned from one KB node to another. For example, reusing the learned filtering models from Willie Nelson, a famous country singer, to Eddie Rabbitt, another country singer. Transfer learning requires three components: the target task (e.g. the problem to be solved), the source task(s) (e.g. auxiliary data, previously studied problem), and criteria to select appropriate source tasks. The objectives of my dissertation are twofold. First, it explores methods to identify informative source nodes from which to transfer. Second, it constructs a knowledge transfer network to represent the transfer learning relationship between KB nodes. This proposed research applies a transfer learning method -- Segmented Transfer (ST) -- and a knowledge representation -- Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN) -- to approach the area of KBE. The primary research questions include: What are the transferable objects in information filtering algorithms? What are the KB nodes of high transferability? What are the factors that determine the transfer learning relationship? Does it manifest on a knowledge transfer network representation? This interdisciplinary research crosses the study area of information filtering, machine learning, knowledge representation, and network analysis. This proposal motivates the problem of KBE, discusses the research methodology and proposed experiments, and reviews related works in information filtering and transfer learning. This line of research hopes to extend the application of transfer learning to KBE and to explore a new dimension of IF. The proposed ST and KTN intends to bring interdisciplinary approaches in the emerging field of KBE.",

        "abstract":"Relevance feedback is a powerful technique for content-based image retrieval. Many parameter estimation approaches have been proposed for relevance feedback. However, most of them have only utilized information of the relevant retrieved images, and have given up, or have not made great use of information of the irrelevant retrieved images. This paper presents a novel approach to update the interweights of integrated probability function by using the information of both relevant and irrelevant retrieved images. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach, especially in the situation of no relevant retrieved images.",

        "abstract":"Data sharing is pivotal in current medical practice so as to better treat patients by taking the best medical decisions, and to optimize healthcare costs by reducing the need to repeat unnecessary medical tests and by better managing healthcare structures. To improve the delivery of treatment outcomes and test results, the request-triggered retrieval of clinical documents provided by current Health Information Systems is not sufficient. The addition of a notification solution is necessary to inform users as soon as their clinical documents of interest have been produced so that they can retrieve them by means of the traditional Health Information Systems. In addition, this notification solution also has to implement the event-based information exchange patterns, which characterize the current attempts at integrating heterogeneous Health Information Systems in a seamless manner. This paper proposes an architecture for an effective asynchronous notification of clinical documents. Our intention is to bridge the gap between primary and secondary care, and between the clinical personnel and the administrators. The proposed solution is based on a publish\/subscribe service, properly extended to allow us to jointly notify collections of correlated documents. Moreover, it has been implemented by means of a web service-based platform in accordance with the Web Service Notification specification so as to obtain a solution easy to integrate and manage. A systematic analysis has been carried out to assess the suitability of the implemented solution to satisfy the requirements for notifying medical documents, and to evaluate the notification latency in different use conditions.",

        "abstract":"The results of a numerical simulation of flow through an artificial heart and through an artificial tilting-disk heart valve are presented. The simulation involves solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations; the solution process is described. The details and difficulties of mod eling these particular geometries are discussed. The arti ficial heart geometry uses a single moving grid, and the valve computation uses an overlaid-grid approach with one moving grid and one stationary grid. The equations must be solved iteratively for each discrete time step of the computations, requiring a significant amount of computing time. It is particularly difficult to analyze and present the fluid physics represented by these calcula tions because of the time-varying nature of the flow, and because the flows are internal. The use of three- dimensional graphics and scientific visualization tech niques have become instrumental in solving these problems.",

The primary issue was that the TCP additive increase\/multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm is not suitable for \"long fat networks\". While this is a known problem, the magnitude of the impact on application performance was much greater than anticipated. We were able to overcome much of the impact, by altering the AIMD coefficients. Such an approach, of course, is non-TCP compliant, and there was insufficient time to test the network friendliness of these modifications.",

It deals with an integrated networking framework stemming from the IEEE 1451.1 object-based networking model, complemented by the Internet Protocol (IP) multicast that mediates efficient and unified access from Internet to distributed components. The kernel of the paper deals with tools and techniques aiming to prop specification and design life cycle phases of applications under development.",

        "abstract":"While remote conference systems have been extensively studied and developed in the past with various user scenarios, many people still rely on simple tools like messengers or video chats that deliver only visual and auditory information of each remote participant as their primary methods of real time remote communication on their computers and tablets. With the simple tools, people still perform variety of tasks. This paper analyzes the tasks performed in remote conference tools running on general purpose PCs or tablets, and categorizes them into different types based on their characteristics. We performed a controlled user experiment to discover behavioral differences observed from each type of the tasks using eye trackers. The study revealed that users showed different behavioral patterns for different task types in both subjective reporting and the eye gaze data. Based on the results, we also provide a general guideline for the screen configuration of a remote conference tool.",

The new class of algorithms, referred\n to as cone-beam reconstruction by moving frames, enables numerical implementation of exact cone-beam inversion using its intrinsic\n geometry. In particular, our algorithm allows a 3-D discrete approach to the differentiation-backprojection operator on the\n curved manifolds appearing in all analytical cone-beam inverse formulations. The enabling technique, called the method of\n moving frames, has been popular in the computer vision community for many years [3]. Although cone-beam image reconstruction\n has come from a different origin and has been until now developed along very different lines from computer vision algorithms,\n we can find analogies in their line-and-plane geometry. We demonstrate how the moving frame technique can be made into a ubiquitous\n and powerful computational tool for designing and implementing more robust and more accurate cone-beam reconstruction algorithms.\n \n ",

        "abstract":"Rising concern over the poor state of chronic disease management led to the user-informed design and development of a home tele-monitoring system. Focus groups with patients and primary care providers guided the research team towards a design that would accommodate the work-flow and concerns of the healthcare providers and the low use and comfort with technology found among the patient population. The system was trialed in a before-and-after pilot study of 34 patients with diabetes and hypertension. Findings demonstrate a significant improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. An RCT beginning in 2007 is being conducted to confirm these findings. It is hypothesized that this user-centred approach, utilizing focus groups, iterative design and human factors methods of evaluation, will lead to the next-generation of home tele-monitoring applications that are more intuitive, less cumbersome, and ultimately bring about greater patient compliance and better physician management.",

The difference with existing approaches is that we propose a test procedure based on the structure of the model and the prior test history that can be used for exhaustive testing in an efficient way. On top of that we provide a statistical stopping rule, that is independent of the underlying way of walking through the system, which allows us to stop earlier with a certain statistical reliability.",

        "abstract":"A large strain elastoplastic constitutive model based on hyperelasticity and multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient tensor is extended to viscous case, in a framework similar to the one that has been proposed by Ponthot in an hypoelastic context. In this way a very useful framework can be obtained, able to deal with both rate dependent and rate independent problems. In this work a review of theoretical details and numerical implementation of the model are discussed. Similarly to what is done in rate independent plasticity, a Newton-Raphson scheme has been used to solve the non linear consistency condition in order to compute the viscoplastic multiplier. A plane strain plate with a central circular hole under tension is simulated in order to test the proposed model. Large deformation effects are considered in all the simulations carried out. Different parameters of the constitutive model are varied in order to study the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract":"Seamless vertical handover is a key requirement in heterogeneous wireless networks where different networks are integrated. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced information server (EIS) to accelerate vertical handover procedures in IEEE 802.21 media independent handover (MIH) networks. Based on the EIS, we propose an improved vertical handover procedure in which wireless channel conditions are estimated by exploiting spatial and temporal locality at the EIS, and therefore time consuming channel scanning procedures can be skipped. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce the vertical handover latency under diverse environments.",

Optimal auction mechanism designs are used to analyze the bargaining process. When there is no likelihood of carrier bankruptcy, the shipper benefits more from joint liability with the carrier than under a rule of strict liability of the carrier. Carriers, on the other hand, free from the potential of bankruptcy, stand to benefit more from strict liability. Under conditions where carrier bankruptcy could result from an accident, the shipper benefits more from strict liability than joint liability, and the reverse is true for carriers. A liability rule which is socially desirable depends upon the safety investments by carriers, carrier asset levels and the level of common knowledge of the accident probability of individual carriers.<\/P>",

One area of application for such computers is the field of neural networks. This article presents a study, and two parallel implementations, of a specific neural incremental classifier of visual patterns. This neural network is incremental in that network units are created whenever the classifier is not able to recognize correctly a pattern. The dynamic nature of the model renders the parallel algorithms rather complex.",

        "abstract":"Today's systems for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) suffer from several drawbacks: First, user inter- faces are much too complicated for average users. Sec- ond, the quality of results tends to be low. Finally, que- rying performance with often long reply times is unsat- isfactory. We have developed a model for CBIR searches in- tended to overcome these drawbacks where the user has to select only one or more example images to initiate a query. Out of the examples the actual query including feature selection and weighting is generated automati- cally. The results of the first query may later on be re- fined by relevance feedback. We discuss the major com- ponents necessary for our approach and the results achieved in our test environment.",

        "abstract":"In recent years, several companies and researchers focused on evaluating the impacts of Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technologies on supply chain performance. This paper deals with the introduction of an RFID technology in an entity where printers are Configured-To-Order (CTO). The objective is to evaluate the impact of this technology on system performances such as resource utilization, cycle time and yield. Therefore, we developed a model of discrete event simulation using Automod and we made a comparison between a baseline scenario and an RFID scenario. Results show that RFID shortens cycle times, increases yield, and creates imbalance of processing times that should be corrected by rethinking resource allocation.",

        "abstract":"This article addresses downlink resource allocation strategies in LTE release 8, using orthogonal frequency division access (OFDMA). We consider 3GPP long-term evolution resource allocation strategies for allocating higher-layer data to the basic resource allocation units (slots) of OFDMA frames. Then, we introduce two simple allocation methods: adaptive slot allocation and reservation-based slot allocation. Both approaches consider a fair resource allocation among different types of service data flow (SDF) by considering their quality of service (QoS) characteristics and their channel qualities. The ultimate objective of the proposed approaches is to maximize the capacity of the system subject to the QoS constraints for each type of SDF in terms of data rate and bit error rate.",

        "abstract":"Recognition of burning states is a critical issue in sintering process control of rotary kiln, and the recognition is usually based on the temperatures of burning zone. Recently, flame image-based burning states recognition has received much attention. However, most of the methods reported involve image segmentation, which is a very challenging problem due to the poor quality of flame images of rotary kiln, and the recognition accuracy is hard to guarantee. In this study, we propose a new method for burning states recognition without demanding image segmentation. The basic idea of this new method is to extract features from eigen-flame images to classify these flame images using probabilistic neural network. The advantages of the new method are threefold. Firstly, the new method is computationally more efficient than image segmentation-based methods. Once the eigen-flame images are obtained off-line, feature extraction is simply a process of correlating an image with each of the eigen-flame images. Secondly, the eigen-flame image-based features capture the global characteristics of an image and hence can lead to more accurate recognition. Thirdly, the new method is robust and is able to deal with images with poor quality. The proposed new method is validated through extensive experimental studies, to show that the new method improves recognition accuracy substantially compared with image segmentation-based methods and temperature-based methods. It is expected that more consistent product quality, higher yield and lower energy consumption can be achieved if the new burning state recognizer is incorporated into our previously developed hybrid control system for rotary kiln.",

        "abstract":"Wireless sensor networks are growing from a few hand-placed devices to more large-scale networks in terms of coverage and node density. For various concerns, such as scalability, larger network sizes require some management of the large volume of data that a sensor network delivers. One way to manage this data is processing information in the network. This paper investigates how a sensor network's network architecture (specifically, the neighborhood structure) can influence the conclusions that a sensor network makes from its measurements. The results demonstrate that non-planar structures are infeasible for routing and some in-network processing applications. Structures with low average edge lengths give better quantitative results, while those with high edge densities give better qualitative results.",

        "abstract":"We propose a new data-driven transformation that facilitates many data mining, interpretation, and analysis tasks. Our approach, called MembershipMap, strives to extract the underlying sub-concepts of each raw attribute, and uses the orthogonal union of these sub-concepts to define a new space. The sub-concept soft labels of each point in the original space determine the position of that point in the new space. Since sub-concept labels are prone to uncertainty inherent in the original data and in the initial extraction process, a combination of labeling schemes that are based on different measures of uncertainty will be presented. In particular, we introduce the CrispMap, SoftMap, and PossibilisticMap. We show that the MembershipMap can be used as a flexible pre-processing tool to support such tasks as: sampling, data cleaning, and outlier detection.",

In this paper, we focus on improving range resolutions of GNSS illuminator based SS-BSAR with the method of spectrum synthesis of ultra-wide-band (UWB). Narrow bandwidth signals, such as GPS P code, can be spliced into a wider signal. Simulation results show that it can effectively increase signal processing bandwidth, improve range resolution and target recognition capabilities.",

        "abstract":"Signaling protocols, primarily used to set up and teardown connections, are essential in connection-oriented networks. Up to now, signaling protocols are mostly implemented in software for two reasons: complexity and the requirement for flexibility. Adversely, the price paid is in performance. Software implementations of signaling protocols are rarely capable of handling over 1000 calls\/s. Corresponding call setup delays per switch are in the order of milliseconds. To improve performance for high-speed networks, we implemented a subset of the resource reservation protocol\u2014traffic engineering signaling protocol in reconfigurable field programmable gate array hardware. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of 1000x speedup vis-\u00c0-vis software implementations. The impact of this work is far-reaching in that it enables connection-oriented networks to support new applications that require rate guarantees but have short call holding times.",

        "abstract":"An effective molecular dipole-moment of 7-13eAngstrom is routinely observed during time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) testing of silica-based dielectrics. This rather narrow range of values is independent of oxide thickness, oxide test area, electrode materials, polarity, test temperature and oxide-growth conditions and strongly suggests a fundamental molecular property. A Mie-Gruneisen analysis of the molecular bonding states indicates that the upper-end of the effective dipole-moment range (13eAngstrom) is associated with a stretched siliconoxygen bond while the lower-end (7eAngstrom) is consistent with a hole-captured silicon-oxygen bond. This would serve as molecular evidence that both current and field play important roles in TDDB. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Healthcare analysts are particularly interested in various computer informatics areas such as; knowledge representation from data, anomaly detection, outbreak detection methods and syndromic surveillance applications. Although various parametric and non-parametric approaches are being proposed to classify information from data, classification tree diagrams provide an interactive visualization to analysts as compared to other methods. In this work we discuss application of classification tree diagrams to classify information from medical data in healthcare applications. ",

        "abstract":"In 1989, Ron Rivest introduced the MD2 Message DigestAlgorithm which takes as input a message of arbitrary lengthand produces as output a 128-bit message digest, by appendingsome redundancy to the message and then iteratively applyinga 32 bytes to 16 bytes compression function. MD2 Message DigestAlgorithm is one of the most frequently used hashing functionwith MD4, MD5, SHA, SHA-1. Some attacks against MD4 and MD5 havebeen presented by Dobbertin. Up to now, no attack against MD2has been presented.This function has beenupdated in 1993 in the RFC 1423 document. It was conjecturedthat the number of operations needed to get two messages havingthe same message digest is on the order of 2^64(using the birthday paradox), and that the complexity of invertingthe hash function is on the order of 2^128 operations.No attack against this function has been published so far. Inthis paper, we propose a low complexity method to find collisionsfor the compression function of MD2. The easiness to find thesecollisions could imply that the first conjecture is false ifthese collisions can be used to make global collisions for MD2.",

        "abstract":"This paper focuses on trustworthy computation systems and proposes a novel intrusion detection scheme for linear consensus networks with misbehaving nodes. This prototypical control problem is relevant in network security applications. The objective is for each node to detect and isolate the misbehaving nodes using only the information flow adopted by standard consensus protocols. We focus on the single misbehaving node problem. Our technical approach is based on the theory of Unknown Input Observability. First, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the misbehavior to be observable and for the identity of the faulty node to be detectable. Second, we design a distributed unknown input estimator, and we characterize its convergence rate in the \"equal-neighbor\" model and in the general case. Third and finally, we propose a complete detection and isolation scheme and provide some remarks on the filter convergence time. We conclude the paper with the numerical study of a consensus problem and of a robotic deployment problem.",

        "abstract":"We have developed a vision-based interface based on body position for viewpoint control in an immersive projection display. The 3D position of the arms and head of the user are tracked by image processing without the need to attach devices to the user. This provides freedom of movement and increases the immersion in the virtual environment. Images are captured using two high-sensitivity monochrome cameras suitable for the dark condition in the projection display. The edges of both hands and the top of the head are tracked in order to control the user's viewpoint by estimating the variance of the position. We evaluated the utility of the interface in an experiment where subjects performed walk-through trials in 3D space, comparing the body-position interface with a joystick. The results indicate that the performance of the body-position interface is comparable to that of the joystick in terms of viewpoint control, but enhances the sensation of speed. The developed system is applicable as a non-contact user interface for moving around in a virtual environment.",

        "abstract":"The use of high-level nets, such as coloured Petri nets, is very convenient for modelling complex controllable systems in order to have a compact, readable and structured specification. However, when coming to the analysis phase, using too elaborate types becomes a burden. A good trade-off between expressiveness and analysis capabilities is then to have only simple types, which is achieved with symmetric nets. These latter nets enjoy the possibility of generating a symbolic reachability graph, which is much smaller than the whole state space and still allows for exhaustive analysis. In this paper, we extend the symmetric net model with bags on arcs. Hence, variables can be bags of tokens, leading to more flexible models. We show that symmetric nets with bags also allow for applying the symbolic reachability graph technique with application to deadlock detection and more generally for safety properties.",

        "abstract":"Olfactory perception is the sense of smell that allows an organism to detect chemical in its environment. The first step in odor transduction is mediated by binding odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) which belong to the heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) super-family. Mammalian ORs are disposed in clusters on virtually all chromosomes. They are encoded by the largest multigene family (similar to 1000 members) in the genome of mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas Drosophila contains only 60 genes. Each OR specifically recognizes a set of odorous molecules that share common molecular features. However, local mutations affect the DNA sequences of these receptors. Hence, to study the changes among affected and non-affected, we use unsupervised learning (clustering). In this paper, a scaled fuzzy graph model for clustering has been used to study the changes before and after the local mutation on DNA sequences of ORs. At the fractional dimensional level, our experimental study confirms its accuracy.",

        "abstract":"An increasingly large number of firms outsource their information technology (IT). Firms that contemplate such outsourcing have two alternatives: (1) a contract with a vendor (i.e., outsourcing) or (2) setting up their own IT subsidiary (i.e., quasi-outsourcing). This study examines some of the determinants of the outsourcing versus quasi-outsourcing decision. Using primary data collected in France and Germany, we show that the decision is strongly influenced by both internal (i.e., asset-specificity, size, and internal organization of IT) and external (i.e., institutional environment) determinants.",

        "abstract":"Much data in the Web is hidden behind Web query interfaces. In most cases the only means to \"surface\" the content of a Web database is by formulating complex queries on such interfaces. Applications such as Deep Web crawling and Web database integration require an automatic usage of these interfaces. Therefore, an important problem to be addressed is the automatic extraction of query interfaces into an appropriate model. We hypothesize the existence of a set of domain-independent \"commonsense design rules\" that guides the creation of Web query interfaces. These rules transform query interfaces into schema trees. In this paper we describe a Web query interface extraction algorithm, which combines HTML tokens and the geometric layout of these tokens within a Web page. Tokens are classified into several classes out of which the most significant ones are text tokens and field tokens. A tree structure is derived for text tokens using their geometric layout. Another tree structure is derived for the field tokens. The hierarchical representation of a query interface is obtained by iteratively merging these two trees. Thus, we convert the extraction problem into an integration problem. Our experiments show the promise of our algorithm: it outperforms the previous approaches on extracting query interfaces on about 6.5% in accuracy as evaluated over three corpora with more than 500 Deep Web interfaces from 15 different domains.",

        "abstract":"We study the performance of the subspace (SS), cross-relation (CR) and two-step maximum likelihood (TSML) methods for estimating the impulse responses of multiple FIR channels driven by an unknown input sequence. Assuming a large data size or\/and a high SNR, the estimation variances of the SS and CR methods are derived. The performances of the three methods are studied and compared against the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). It is shown that the TSML method significantly outperforms the SS and CR methods and attains the CRB over a wide range of SNR. It is also shown that the SS method is more robust to ill channel conditions than the CR method, while the two methods show nearly identical performances for well-conditioned channels.",

        "abstract":"We study interval-valued constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), in which the aim is to find an assignment of intervals to a given set of variables subject to constraints on the relative positions of intervals. Many well-known problems such as INTERVAL GRAPH RECOGNITION and INTERVAL SATISFIABILITY can be considered as examples of such CSPs. One interesting question concerning such problems is to determine exactly how the complexity of an interval-valued CSP depends on the set of constraints allowed in instances. For the framework known as Allen's interval algebra this question was completely answered earlier by the authors, by giving a complete description of the tractable cases and showing that all remaining cases are NP-complete.Here we extend the qualitative framework of Allen's algebra with additional constraints on the lengths of intervals. We allow these length constraints to be expressed as Horn disjunctive linear relations, a well-known tractable and sufficiently expressive form of constraints. The class of problems we consider contains, in particular, problems that are very closely related to the previously studied UNIT INTERVAL GRAPH SANDWICH problem. We completely characterize sets of qualitative relations for which the CSP augmented with arbitrary length constraints of the above form is tractable. We also show that, again, all the remaining cases are NP-complete.",

        "abstract":"Privacy seals were developed to address concerns about online privacy. However, seals are widely misinterpreted by consumers as privacy protection. This research assessed how well privacy policies matched the standards promised by the seal authorities and compared the privacy protection practices of participating and non-participating sites. Privacy policy statements were interpreted as a form of persuasive communication that attempts to minimize the risks of providing personal information while emphasizing the benefits of personal disclosure. There were few differences in the privacy practices between seal authorities: TKUSTe and BBBOnLine participants offered about the same degree of privacy protection assurances and they were equal with regard to the amount or depth of personal information they requested. Notably, unsealed sites offered nearly equal privacy assurances and made fewer personal information requests than the sealed sites. However, seal program participants did provide superior access to information and assurances of data security.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents a new recursive Bayesian linear regression (RBLR) algorithm for adaptive pattern classification. This algorithm performs machine learning in nonstationary environments. A classification model is adopted in model training. The initial model parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood function of training data. To activate the sequential learning capability, the randomness of the model parameters is properly expressed by the normal-gamma distribution. When new adaptation data are input, sufficient statistics are accumulated to obtain a new normal-gamma distribution as the posterior distribution. Accordingly, a recursive Bayesian algorithm is established to update the hyperparameters. The trajectory of nonstationary environments can be traced to perform the adaptive classification. Such recursive Bayesian models are used to satisfy the requirements of maximal class margin and minimal training error, which are essential in support vector machines (SVMs). In the experiments on the UCI machine learning repository and the FERET facial database, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-art algorithms including SVMs and relevance vector machines (RVMs). The improvement is not only obtained in batch training but also in sequential adaptation. Face classification performance is continuously elevated by adapting to changing facial conditions.",

        "abstract":"This paper compares the performance of an SQL solution that implements a relational data model with a document store named MongoDB. We report on the performance of a single node configuration of each data store and assume the database is small enough to fit in main memory. We analyze utilization of the CPU cores and the network bandwidth to compare the two data stores. Our key findings are as follows. First, for those social networking actions that read and write a small amount of data, the join operator of the SQL solution is not slower than the JSON representation of MongoDB. Second, with a mix of actions, the SQL solution provides either the same performance as MongoDB or outperforms it by 20%. Third, a middle-tier cache enhances the performance of both data stores as query result look up is significantly faster than query processing with either system.",

        "abstract":"Training of combat fighter pilots is often conducted using either human opponents or non-adaptive computer-generated force (CGF) inserted with the doctrine for conducting air combat mission. The novelty and challenges of such non-adaptive doctrine-driven CGF is often lost quickly. Incorporating more complex knowledge manually is known to be tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, a study of using adaptive CGF to learn from the real-time interactions with human pilots to extend the existing doctrine is conducted in this work. The goal of this study is to show how an adaptive CGF can be more effective than a non-adaptive doctrine-driven CGF for simulator-based training of combat pilots. Driven by a family of self-organizing neural network, the adaptive CGF can be inserted with the same doctrine as the non-adaptive CGF. Using a commercial-grade training simulation platform, two human-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are conducted using the adaptive CGF and the non-adaptive doctrine-driven CGF to engage two diverse groups of human pilots in 1-v-1 dogfights. The quantitative results and qualitative assessments of the CGFs by the human pilots are collected for all the training sessions. The qualitative assessments show the trainee pilots are able to match the adaptive CGF to the desirable attributes while the veteran pilots are only able to observe some learning from the adaptive CGF. The quantitative results show that the adaptive agent needs a lot more training sessions to learn the necessary knowledge to match up to the human pilots.",

        "abstract":"This paper proposes a new approach to model-based clustering under prior knowl- edge. The proposed formulation can be interpreted from two different angles: as penalized logistic regression, where the class labels are o nly indirectly observed (via the probability density of each class); as finite mixtur e learning under a group- ing prior. To estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we derive a (gener- alized) EM algorithm with a closed-form E-step, in contrast with other recent approaches to semi-supervised probabilistic clustering which require Gibbs sam- pling or suboptimal shortcuts. We show that our approach is ideally suited for image segmentation: it avoids the combinatorial nature Markov random field pri- ors, and opens the door to more sophisticated spatial priors (e.g., wavelet-based) in a simple and computationally efficient way. Finally, we ex tend our formulation to work in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or discriminative modes.",

        "abstract":"Content-based image retrieval systems have to cope with two different regimes: understanding broadly the categories of interest to the user, and refining the search in this or these categories to converge to specific images among them. Here, in contrast with other types of retrieval systems, these two regimes are of great importance since the search initialization is hardly optimal (i.e. the page-zero problem) and the relevance feedback must tolerate the semantic gap of the image's visual features. We present a new approach that encompasses these two regimes, and infers from the user actions a seamless transition between them. Starting from a query-free approach meant to solve the page-zero problem, we propose an adaptive exploration\/exploitation trade-off that transforms the original framework into a versatile retrieval framework with full searching capabilities. Our approach is compared to the state-of-the-art it extends by conducting user evaluations on a collection of 60,000 images from the ImageNet database.",

        "abstract":"We present a technique for automatically verifying safety properties of concurrent programs, in particular programs which rely on subtle dependencies of local states of different threads, such as lock-free implementations of stacks and queues in an environment without garbage collection. Our technique addresses the joint challenges of infinite-state specifications, an unbounded number of threads, and an unbounded heap managed by explicit memory allocation. Our technique builds on the automata-theoretic approach to model checking, in which a specification is given by an automaton that observes the execution of a program and accepts executions that violate the intended specification. We extend this approach by allowing specifications to be given by a class of infinite-state automata. We show how such automata can be used to specify queues, stacks, and other data structures, by extending a data-independence argument. For verification, we develop a shape analysis, which tracks correlations between pairs of threads, and a novel abstraction to make the analysis practical. We have implemented our method and used it to verify programs, some of which have not been verified by any other automatic method before.",

Zur Ermittlung der Haufigkeiten bestimmter Kristalle soll die Erkennung und Klassifikation der Formen automatisiert werden. In dieser Arbeit werden neben einem Uberblick uber die in Frage kommenden Bildaufnahme-, Vorverarbeitungs- und Segmentierungsverfahren Merkmale entwickelt, die insbesondere der Erkennung regelmasiger geometrischer Objekte geeignet sind. Zur Klassifikation wird ein schnelles Verfahren vorgeschlagen, das ahnlich dem menschlichen Experten per Elimination der unplausibelsten Klasse zum Ergebnis fuhrt.",

        "abstract":"The truncated Fourier series exhibits oscillation that does not disappear as the number of terms in the truncation is increased. This paper introduces 2-D fractional Fourier series (FrFS) according to the 1-D fractional Fourier series, and finds such a Gibbs oscillation also occurs in the partial sums of FrFS for bivariate functions at a jump discontinuity. In this study, the 2-D inverse polynomial reconstruction method (IPRM) which is a method based on the inversion of the transformation matrix that represents the fraction Fourier space has been used to remove the Gibbs effect. The purpose of this study is to verify the 2-D IPRM has the similar effection for removing the Gibbs oscillation for partial fractional Fourier sums of bivariate functions. Numerical experiments verify the efficiency and accuracy of IPRM.",

        "abstract":"The onward dispersion of Ethernet based structures with decentralized and distributed multi-user environments in automation leads towards Networked Automation Systems (NAS). The new modern structures are less expensive and at the same time more flexible than classical ones. However, they induce non-deterministic delays. Hence, the detailed analysis of the resulting response time is not only prerequisite for the responsible use; it also enables to check dependability properties prior-to changes or expansions of the system. To do so, a new modeling language - DesLaNAS - is introduced, which accounts for the special needs of modeling NAS. Based on Probabilistic Model Checking for the analysis, the influence of different components and of net-based behavior modes like resource-sharing and synchronization on the resulting response time is discussed.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents a new adaptive algorithm that aims to control the exploration\/exploitation trade-off dynamically. The algorithm is designed based on three-dimensional cellular genetic algorithms (3D-cGAs). In this study, our methodology is based on the change in the global selection pressure induced by dynamic tuning of the local selection rate. The parameter tuning of the local selection method is a way to define the global selection pressure. A diversity speed measure is used to guide the algorithm. Therefore, the integration of existing techniques helps in achieving our aims. A benchmark of well-known continuous test functions and real world problems was selected to investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed. In addition, we provide a comparison between the proposed algorithm and other static and dynamic algorithms in order to study the different effects on the performance of the algorithms. Overall, the results show that the proposed algorithm provides the most desirable performance in terms of efficiency, efficacy, and speed for most problems considered. The results also confirm that problems of various characteristics require different selection pressures, which are difficult to be identified.",

        "abstract":"A large set of partial data models is used in designing a large information system. These partial data models provide several complementary views on the system to be developed. This however leads to a need for compositional models that are able to produce a single integrated model. These data models are often described by a class diagram of Unified Modeling Language because it is a very popular modeling language and describing a static view of a system. In this paper, we present syntax and semantics of a class diagram describing a data model. We propose a family of well-formed class diagrams as a domain of class diagram algebra and composition operations as merge and difference operations. We then show that algebraic properties as associativity, commutativity and involutivity are desired for model management to develop a large information system.",

        "abstract":"Health care services in German hospitals are causing immense expenses. Successful IT Governance might help to support specific challenges for every organization with an adequate use of IT. The market structure of hospitals in Germany is very heterogeneous, e.g. in size and sponsorship. This paper analyses the state of the art of IT Governance based on a survey among 220 IT executives in German hospitals. The quantitative analyses of collected survey data reveal that hospitals govern their IT differently according to size and sponsorship. In addition, our analyses show that decision-making authority for the IT budget rises with hospital size and is positively correlated with the fraction of IT projects in the overall IT budget. We also show that the investments in innovative IT projects increase with hospital size. Our study revealed that a high number of private and larger hospitals lack a systematic IT Governance approach within the decision domain on IT projects. This study is the first to shed light into the empirical situation of IT Governance in German hospitals.",

        "abstract":"Advances in modeling and control will be required to meet future technical challenges in microelectronics manufacturing. The implementation of closed-loop control on key unit operations has been limited due to a dearth of suitable in situ measurements, variations in process equipment and wafer properties, limited process understanding, non-automated operational practices, and lack of trained personnel. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art for process control in semiconductor processing, and covers the key unit operations of lithography, plasma etching, thin film deposition, rapid thermal processing, and chemical-mechanical planarization. The relationship of process (equipment) models to control strategies is elaborated because recently there has been a considerable level of activity in model development in industry and academia. A proposed control framework for integrating factory control and equipment scheduling, supervisory control, feedback control, statistical process control, and fault detection\/diagnosis in microelectronics manufacturing is presented and discussed.",

        "abstract":"When aggregating information from a group of agents, accepting the pieces of information shared by all agents is a natural requirement. In this paper, we investigate such a unanimity condition in the setting of propositional merging. We discuss two interpretations of the unanimity condition. We show that the first interpretation is captured by existing postulates for merging. But the second interpretation is not, and this leads to the introduction of a new disjunction postulate (Disj). It turns out that existing operators satisfying (Disj) do not perform well with respect to the standard criteria used to evaluate merging operators: logical properties, computational complexity and strategy-proofness. To fill this gap, we introduce two new families of propositional merging operators, quota operators and Gmin operators, which satisfy (Disj), and achieve interesting trade-offs with respect to the logical, computational, and strategy-proofness criteria.",

From this point of view, it is common to construct them by using mainframes with high reliability, high processing capacity and excellent continuity. We have met this need by developing an ultra-large-scale cooperative distributed system that realizes a mission criticality level equivalent to conventional systems, while at the same time achieving greatly reduced cost and meeting the development time frame of 2 years.

        "abstract":"In the traditional ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, ants are utilized to solve various combinatorial optimization problems regardless of their individual velocities. In this work, however, a moving ant estimator (MAE) is developed on the premise that the issue of moving velocity of each ant is considered. The determination of the velocity of each ant depends directly on the normalized weights between the one-step prediction of the ant starting position and the selected one-step position. Besides this, the velocity of each ant is further adjusted locally based on its individual moving ability, which is defined in the corresponding \u201cpheromone\u201d update process just as the traditional ACO algorithm. To improve the accuracy of the proposed estimator, two improved versions are investigated. Numerical simulations show that the moving ant estimator, as well as its two improved versions, could estimate adaptively the state of maneuvering or non-maneuvering target. To verify the effectiveness of the MAE, the obtained results are compared with those from PF, IMMPF, etc.",

        "abstract":"Radiation-induced soft error rate (SER) degrades the reliability of static random access memory (SRAM)-based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This paper presents a new built-in 2-D Hamming product code (2-D HPC) scheme to provide reliable operation of SRAM-based FPGAs in hostile operating environments such as space. Multibit error correction capability of our built-in 2-D HPC can improve the reliability, and hence, system availability, by orders of magnitude. Simulation results show that the large number of error correction capability of 2-D HPC can recover configuration bits without depending on an external memory preserving a golden copy of the configuration bits. To provide efficient 2-D HPC in a built-in logic, we also propose a new 2-D SRAM buffer. Using the proposed multibit error correction scheme, system availability of an SRAM-based FPGA can be more than 99.9999999% with SRAM cell failures in 1 billion h of operation of 7.",

By tracking the fiducial marker on each side of the cube in real-time, basic operations such as flipping, rotating and tilting can produce various input modalities. We present the results of an experiment that investigate the use of these input modalities to perform a set of experimental tasks. In the experiment we design a discrete angle selection task, varying the angle position and interval. Based on the experimental results, we discuss implications for the design of cube-based interaction techniques.",

        "abstract":"  In this paper, we propose two new constructions of exact-repair minimum storage regenerating (exact-MBR) codes. Both constructions obtain the encoded symbols by first treating the message vector over GF(q) as a linearized polynomial and then evaluating it over an extension field GF(q^m). The evaluation points are chosen so that the encoded symbols at any node are conjugates of each other, while corresponding symbols of different nodes are linearly dependent with respect to GF(q). These properties ensure that data repair can be carried out over the base field GF(q), instead of matrix inversion over the extension field required by some existing exact-MBR codes. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is novel in the construction of exact-MBR codes. One of our constructions leads to exact-MBR codes with arbitrary parameters. These exact-MBR codes have higher data reconstruction complexities but lower data repair complexities than their counterparts based on the product-matrix approach; hence they may be suitable for applications that need a small number of data reconstructions but a large number of data repairs.

        "abstract":"As more and more machines are networked, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication have captured attention of IEEE 802.16 and 3GPP which, however, have only described possible system architecture, features, and issues, but no specification of M2M communication so far. Therefore, it is important for us to define the problems and provide solutions. Since most of the machine devices (MD) are battery equipped, and the number of MD is expected to be significantly more than human population, there are two critical requirements in M2M communications, low uplink energy consumption (EC) and massive access management. In this paper, we propose MD access control algorithms to ensure low uplink EC of M2M communication under the constraint of maximum number of access from MD to BS by implementing grouping and coordinator selection. Moreover, weighting factor which takes channel condition between the coordinator and base station (BS) into consideration is introduced to further improve EC performance. Numerical results show that our algorithms can not only achieve lower EC but also adapt to various distribution of MD.",

        "abstract":"This paper considers the self-stabilizing leader-election problem in a model of interacting anonymous finite-state agents. Leader election is a fundamental problem in distributed systems; many distributed problems are easily solved with the help of a central coordinator. Self-stabilizing algorithms do not require initialization in order to operate correctly and can recover from transient faults that obliterate all state information in the system. Anonymous finite-state agents model systems of identical simple computational nodes such as sensor networks and biological computers. Self-stabilizing leader election is easily shown to be impossible in such systems without additional structure. An eventual leader detector \u03a9? is an oracle that eventually detects the presence or absence of a leader. With the help of \u03a9?, uniform self-stabilizing leader election algorithms are presented for two natural classes of network graphs: complete graphs and rings. The first algorithm works under either a local or global fairness condition, whereas the second requires global fairness.

First of all we perform a sketch-driven segmentation of the scene by means of a Deformation Tolerant version of the Generalized Hough Transform (DTGHT). Using the DTGHT we select in the image some candidate segments to be matched with the user sketch. The candidate segments are then matched with the sketch checking the consistency of the corresponding shapes. Finally, background segments axe used in order to inhibit the recognition process when they cannot be perceptually separated from the object.",

        "abstract":"An Arabic font is difficult to fit as it is cursive in character, having varying curves and cusps. Here, the Arabic character is represented as an outline font fitted with G^1 rational Bezier cubic curves. As a method in reverse engineering, the Arabic character is created by way of digitizing an image that already exists and then fitting G^1 curves automatically to the outline of the digitized image. The outline font representation is done in several phases - contour extraction of font image, corner point's detection and lastly contour segment fitting. Image is considered as binary and boundary is obtained accordingly. Eigenvalues of covariance matrix and the concept of region of support are employed to search for the corners of the Arabic characters which are of varying degrees of smoothness. G^1 rational Bezier cubics, iteratively determined, are used in the last step. The weights are adjusted automatically to get curves that are as close as need be to the digitized data points. This technique can be extended to visualizing outlines of other contour-based images automatically.",

        "abstract":"America faces a real challenge to its position as a global leader in information technology, which impacts the preparedness of the national workforce. The 21st century worker is facing a dynamic environment, where knowledge, speed, and technical proficiency will determine the \"haves\" and the \"have nots.\" This lack of technology proficiency has produced a \"digital divide\" for many underrepresented groups. This paper proposes to use a medium that is culturally relevant to inner-city youth - hip-hop music - to increase information technology awareness and acceptance, fostering use of resources that offer wealth-creation in an Internet-based economy.",

        "abstract":"Media space is a promising but still immature technology to connect distributed sites. We developed a simple additional function that moved a remote camera forward when a local user approached a display so that the approach was amplified by a remote person's expanding image accompanied by motion parallax. We conducted an experiment in which we observed that a movable camera enhanced social telepresence, which is the feeling of facing a remote person in the same room. Despite the camera's movement, subjects believed that the camera did not move and a zoom-in function expanded the image. Surprisingly, a zoom-in camera that expanded the image as the movable camera did, however, was ineffective probably because of a lack of motion parallax. Although we explained nothing about the camera, most subjects noticed that their walking caused the view's expansion. If a remote person initiated the camera's movement, social telepresence could not be enhanced.",

        "abstract":"We state an integer linear programming formulation for the unique characterization of complete simple games, i.e. a special subclass of monotone Boolean functions. In order to apply the parametric Barvinok algorithm to obtain enumeration formulas for these discrete objects we provide a tailored decomposition of the integer programming formulation into a finite list of suitably chosen sub-cases. As for the original enumeration problem of Dedekind on Boolean functions we have to introduce some parameters to be able to derive exact formulas for small parameters. Recently, Freixas et\u00a0al. have proven an enumeration formula for complete simple games with two types of voters. We will provide a shorter proof and a new enumeration formula for complete simple games with two minimal winning vectors.",

        "abstract":"Let G\u2009=\u2009(V,E) be an edge-weighted graph, and let w(H) denote the sum of the weights of the edges in a subgraph H of G. Given a positive integer k, the balanced tree partitioning problem requires to cover all vertices in V by a set $\\mathcal{T}$ of k trees of the graph so that the ratio \u03b1 of $\\max_{T\\in \\mathcal{T}}w(T)$ to w(T *)\/k is minimized, where T * denotes a minimum spanning tree of G. The problem has been used as a core analysis in designing approximation algorithms for several types of graph partitioning problems over metric spaces, and the performance guarantees depend on the ratio \u03b1 of the corresponding balanced tree partitioning problems. It is known that the best possible value of \u03b1 is 2 for the general metric space. In this paper, we study the problem in the d-dimensional Euclidean space \u211d d , and break the bound 2 on \u03b1, showing that $\\alpha",

The paper sketches shortly how a corresponding hypothesis could be developed. Furthermore, it presents several recommendations that aim at the reduction of confounding effects. It is believed that these recommendations are applicable to other experiments in the domain of MDE, too. Finally, the paper reports on initial experiences that have been made while formulating test questions.",

        "abstract":"It has been shown that cyclostationarity in the received signal allows the receiver to blindly identify the channel impulse response using only second-order statistics. In orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, cyclostationarity is embedded at the transmitter due to cyclic prefix. In this paper, a subspace approach based on second-order statistics is proposed for blind channel identification in OFDM systems. We derive a sufficient condition that guarantees all the channels to be identifiable no matter what their zero locations are. Computer simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over methods reported earlier in the literature",

        "abstract":"This paper is first in a series of papers studying a system-theoretic approach to the problem of reconstructing an analog signal from its samples. The idea, borrowed from earlier treatments in the control literature, is to address the problem as a hybrid model-matching problem in which performance is measured by system norms. In this paper we present the paradigm and revise underlying technical tools, such as the lifting technique and some topics of the operator theory. This material facilitates a systematic and unified treatment of a wide range of sampling and reconstruction problems, recovering many hitherto considered different solutions and leading to new results. Some of these applications are discussed in the second part.",

One of the outcomes of such analyses concerns the non-existence of linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients annihilating these sequences, and, accordingly, the non-existence of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients annihilating their generating functions. In particular, the corresponding generating functions are transcendental. Asymptotic estimates of certain finite difference sequences come out as a byproduct of the Lindelof approach.",

        "abstract":"Published plate reconstructions commonly show significant differences in initial plate configuration and syn-extensional opening directions. The variability of published models is primarily due to the difficulty associated with restoring crustal stretching history. Here we present an inverse non-rigid kinematic method that inverts plate motion and present day crustal thickness to approximate the history of bulk lateral strain and crustal thinning associated with lithospheric stretching. The kinematic link between plate motion and bulk crustal thickness that is used with this method is based on insights obtained from geodynamic models. We implement this approach in open source kinematic modeling software and apply it to test new Early Mesozoic plate kinematic models of the Central Atlantic. This application shows that the patterns of stretching inferred from the syn-rift basins of the Newark Supergroup can be explained if (1) syn-rift Euler pole flow lines were parallel to the Grand Banks transform margin and (2) initial formation of the East Coast Margin Igneous Province was coincident with the formation of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. These syn-rift to breakup models of the Central Atlantic lead to better constrained models of early seafloor spreading that show full spreading velocities in the ultraslow regime and within the transition from ultraslow to slow spreading regimes.",

This paper deals with automatic planning of base station sites on a studied scenario, maintaining coverage requirement and enabling the transmission of traffic demands distributed over the area. A city scenario with different demands is examined and the advantages\/disadvantages of this method are discussed. The planner and optimizing tasks are based on an iterative K-Means clustering method. The planning method involves base station positioning and selecting antenna main lobe direction. Results of the output network deployment of this algorithm are shown, with various traffic loads over the studied area.",

        "abstract":"Infotech Enterprises Ltd provides IT and engineering design services, and is certified for CMMI level 5, ISO 9000-2000, BS 7799, and AS9100. One of our major customers is a leading aero engines design and manufacturing company in the United States. The customer designs and manufactures jet engines, the most sophisticated breakthrough of the 20(th) century. Around 2001, this customer initiated work on development of an engineering design framework for constant innovation, greater productivity, and better success and profit-ability. It also aimed at resilience against serious loss of knowledge and experience as employees retire or leave suddenly. It is important for organizations to have the resilience to muster lip the required size and skill mix of teams based on need, sometimes at a very short notice. An important component for this resilience is a framework that enables new entrants in the projects, whether employees or companies to which work is assigned, to quickly come up to speed as well as be able to do their work correctly. The framework consists of knowledge repository, design process, visual representation, quick navigation, standardization, and easy workflow. One of our large customers, a leading aero engine design and manufacturing company, under relentless pressure from customers and competitors, had been trying a radical change in the engineering design process. We started working on a solution jointly in 2002. The challenge was to develop a framework that is easy to learn and use, and has the capability for global deployment. We set zip a team of IT specialists who were adept at grasping new technologies quickly. The first decision taken was to use a web browser interface that is commonly used. A standard document storage mechanism based on XML was decided upon. A unique and very convenient method of quickly navigating to the desired point from within a large diagram was developed on the browser. The first version was ready for deployment in 18 months. A 30 percent improvement in engineering design productivity had taken place once the implementation stabilized. By that time, all 4, 000 design engineers in the organization were using the framework. Extracts relating to work outsourced to external companies were passed on to the suppliers, resulting in improvements. This increased organizational resilience in effectively managing varying levels of manpower resource requirement. Other companies of the group are now initiating similar frameworks. IT tools, especially web technologies and connectivity, now make it possible for an organization to implement such a framework within and across engineering design teams, both internal and external. IT should be leveraged by large companies to attain and maintain competitive leadership through resilience.",

        "abstract":"The degree of approximation of infinite-dimensional function classes using finite n -dimensional manifolds has been the subject of a classical field of study in the area of mathematical approximation theory. In Ratsaby and Maiorov (1997), a new quantity \u03c1 n ( F , L q ) which measures the degree of approximation of a function class F by the best manifold H n of pseudo-dimension less than or equal to n in the L q -metric has been introduced. For sets F \u2282 R m it is defined as \u03c1 n ( F , l m q ) = inf H n dist ( F , H n ), where dist ( F , H n ) = sup x\u03f5F inf y\u03f5H n \u2225 x \u2212 y \u2225 l m q and H n \u2282 R m is any set of VC-dimension less than or equal to n where n < m . It measures the degree of approximation of the set F by the optimal set H n \u2282 R m of VC-dimension less than or equal to n in the l m q -metric. In this paper we compute \u03c1 n ( F , l m q ) for F being the unit ball B m p = {x \u03f5 R m : \u2225x\u2225 l m p \u2a7d 1} for any 1 \u2a7d p , q \u2a7d \u221e, and for F being any subset of the boolean m -cube of size larger than 2 m\u03b3 , for any 1 2 <\u03b3< 1 .",

        "abstract":"Digital forensic investigators are often faced with the task of manually examining a large number of (photographic) images to identify potential evidence. The task can be daunting and time-consuming if the target of the investigation is very broad, such as a web hosting service. Current forensic tools are woefully inadequate: they are largely confined to generating pages of thumbnail images and identifying known files through cryptographic bashes. This paper presents a new approach that significantly automates the examination process by relying on image analysis techniques. The strategy is to use previously-identified content (e.g., contraband images) and to perform feature extraction, which captures mathematically the essential properties of the images. Based on this analysis, a feature set database is constructed to facilitate automatic scanning of a target machine for images similar to the ones in the database. An important property of the approach is that it is not possible to recover the original image from the feature set. Therefore, it is possible to build a (potentially very large) database targeting known contraband images that investigators may be barred from collecting directly. The approach can be used to automatically search for case-specific images, contraband or otherwise, and to provide online monitoring of shared storage for early detection of specific images.",

        "abstract":"The Flexible Hypercube is a generalization of binary hypercube networks in that the number of nodes can be arbitrary in contrast to a strict power of 2. Restated, the Flexible Hypercube retains the connectivity and diameter properties of the corresponding hypercube. Although the embedding of complete binary trees in faulty hypercubes has received considerable attention, to our knowledge, no paper has demonstrated how to embed a complete binary tree in a faulty Flexible Hypercube. Therefore, this investigation presents a novel algorithm to facilitate the embedding job when the Flexible Hypercube contains faulty nodes. Of particular concern are the network structures of the Flexible Hypercube that balance the load before as well as after faults start to degrade the performance of the Flexible Hypercube. Furthermore, to obtain the replaceable node of the faulty node, 2-expansion is permitted such that up to (n \u2212 2) faults can be tolerated with congestion 1, dilation 4 and load 1. That is, (n \u2212 1) is the dimension of a Flexible Hypercube. Results presented herein demonstrate that embedding methods are optimized.",

We combine the QPSO search technique with list scheduling to improve the solution quality in short time. At the same time, we produce the solution based on the problem-space heuristic. Several benchmark instances are tested and the experiment results demonstrate much advantage of QPSO to some other heuristics in search ability and performance.",

        "abstract":"Femtocell is one of the promising technologies for improving service quality and data rate of indoor users. Femtocell is short-range, low-cost, and low-power base stations (BS) installed by the consumer indoors. Even though femtocell can provide improved home coverage and capacity for indoor users, it causes interference to macrocell users when femtocell uses the same frequency band of macrocell. To reduce the interference between macrocell and femtocell, it is needed to analyze the characteristic of macrocell and femtocell considering various interference scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the uplink and downlink capacity of macrocell and femtocell according to the strength of femtocell transmit power and the number of femtocells through simulations. Simulation results show that femtocell transmit power and the number of femtocells affect the performance of macrocell. From the results, we find the adequate femtocell transmit power which minimize the performance degradation of macrocell and femtocell. We also investigate capacities of macrocell and femtocell according to the locations of femtocell BS and macrocell UE.",

        "abstract":"Today, most enterprises are embracing the cloud computing paradigm to provide reliable access to business data for mobile consumers. The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is one platform that is fault tolerant and highly scalable within the cloud provisioning landscape. However, the Amazon S3 facility relies on the submission of multiple identification credentials from the data consumer for the purposes of authentication and authorization. This authentication process introduces high communication latency which makes it uninteresting for mobile consumption of enterprise data in a highly distributed environment. This paper presents a middleware-centric framework called MiLAMob that simplifies the authentication process in real time. The middleware employs the OAuth 2.0 technique (E.g. Facebook, Google+, and Personal Login) to identify the end-user and uses security tokens to handle the tedious authentication with Amazon S3 on behalf of the user\/requester. The approach adopted by this paper proves that mobile consumers can efficiently access enterprise data hosted on Amazon S3 in a single request call with less processing effort. Also, the introduction of the middleware enforces additional data protection because the security credentials and the Amazon S3 abstractions are hidden from the mobile application domain and the end users.",

        "abstract":"More and more XML data is generated and used for data exchange. In this paper, we address the problem of filtering XML documents with large number of XPath expressions, which may contain 'ancestor' and 'parent' axes. XPath expressions with these axes are more powerful and flexible for users to describe their interests in publish\/subscribe systems. First, we analyze the characteristics of the 'parent' axis and propose a series of rules to eliminate it in XPath expressions. Then we propose a new index structure called NIndex, which is designed to efficiently store and index large number of XPath expressions. NIndex offers several features which make it especially attractive for the large scale selective dissemination of information, including the ability to handle complex XPath expressions with 'ancestor' and 'parent' axes, and efficient pruning. Based on NIndex, we design a new filtering algorithm with low complexity for our problem. Our experiment results show that our algorithm performs well across a range of XPath expressions and documents.",

Content-based image indexing and retrieval has been an important research area in computer science for the last few decades. The approaches of content-based image retrieval using low level features such as colour, shape and texture are investigated to create a prototype that perceives blood cell images similar to a human. The histogram of red, green, and blue colour components is analyzed. The wavelet decomposition is also used to analyze texture. In addition, morphological operations such as opening and closing are applied to analyze object shape. Lastly, colour, texture, and shape in image retrieval are integrated in order to increase the retrieval accuracy. Experimental results using four different classes of 150 blood cell images showed 95.68% of retrieval accuracy.",

        "abstract":"Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is a new protocol being developed in the IETF|s MPTCP working group in order to provide higher communication availability and to improve the throughput between two multi-addressed endpoints by using multiple paths. Due to the multipath nature and specifically its path management, some new security threats arise apart from those that are already present in standard single-path TCP. These new attacks include flooding and hijacking attacks performed by an off-path attacker. In this paper, we explore different solutions in order to cover the identified security flaws. The main proposal is based on hash chains, which significantly reduces the initial set of threats resulting in a residual group of vulnerabilities, which are also identified.",

        "abstract":"In current System-on-Chip (SoC) design, the main engineering trade-off concerns hardware efficiency and design effort. Hardware efficiency traditionally regards cost versus performance (in high-volume electronics), but recently energy consumption emerged as a dominant criterion, even in products without batteries. \"The\" most effective way to increase HW efficiency is to exploit application characteristics in the HW. The traditional way of looking at HW design tends to consider it a time-consuming and tedious task, however. Given the current lack of HW designers, and the pressure of time-to-market, clearly a desire exists to fine-balance the merits and effort of tuning your HW to your application. This paper discusses methods and tool support for HW application-tuning at different levels of granularity. Furthermore we treat several ways of applying reconfigurable HW to allow both silicon reuse and the ability to tune the HW to the application after fabrication. Our main focus is on a methodology for application-tuning the architecture of DSP datapaths. Our primary contribution is on reusing and generalizing this methodology to application-tuning DSP instraction sets, and providing tool support for efficient compilation for these instruction sets. Furthermore, we propose an architecure for a reconfigurable instruction-decoder, enabling application-tuning of the instruction-set after fabrication.",

        "abstract":"Data mining (DM) techniques are being increasingly used in many modern organizations to retrieve valuable knowledge structures from organizational databases, including data warehouses. An important knowledge structure that can result from data mining activities is the decision tree (DT) that is used for the classification of future events. The induction of the decision tree is done using a supervised knowledge discovery process in which prior knowledge regarding classes in the database is used to guide the discovery. The generation of a DT is a relatively easy task but in order to select the most appropriate DT it is necessary for the DM project team to generate and analyze a significant number of DTs based on multiple performance measures. We propose a multi-criteria decision analysis based process that would empower DM project teams to do thorough experimentation and analysis without being overwhelmed by the task of analyzing a significant number of DTs would offer a positive contribution to the DM process. We also offer some new approaches for measuring some of the performance criteria.",

        "abstract":"In this work, we explore the use of a learning-based framework for retrieval of relevant mammogram images from a database, for purposes of aiding diagnoses. A fundamental issue is how to characterize the notion of similarity between images for use in assessing relevance of images in the database. We investigate the use of several learning algorithms, namely, neural networks and support vector machines, in a two-stage hierarchical learning network for predicting the perceptual similarity from similarity scores collected in human-observer studies. The proposed approach is demonstrated using microcalcification clusters extracted from a database consisting of 76 mammograms. Initial results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage hierarchical learning network outperforms a single-stage learning network.",

        "abstract":"It is known that dynamic allocation of channels and power in a frequency\/time-division multiple access system can improve performance and achieve higher capacity. Various algorithms have been separately proposed for dynamic channel assignment (DCA) and power control. Moreover, integrated dynamic channel and power allocation (DCPA) algorithms have already been proposed based on simple power control algorithms. In this paper, we propose a DCPA scheme based on a novel predictive power control algorithm. The minimum interference DCA algorithm is employed, while simple Kalman filters are designed to provide the predicted measurements of both the channel gains and the interference levels, which are then used to update the power levels. Local and global stability of the network are analyzed and extensive computer simulations are carried out to show the improvement in performance, under the dynamics of user arrivals and departures and user mobility. It is shown that call droppings and call blockings are decreased while, on average, fewer channel reassignments per call are required.",

It is quasi-adaptive in the sense that the common reference string CRS generator can generate the CRS depending on the language parameters. However, the simulation is required to be uniform, i.e., a single efficient simulator should work for the whole class of parametrized languages. For distributions on languages that are linear subspaces of vector spaces over bilinear groups, we give quasi-adaptive computationally sound NIZKs that are shorter and more efficient than Groth-Sahai NIZKs. For many cryptographic applications quasi-adaptive NIZKs suffice, and our constructions can lead to significant improvements in the standard model. Our construction can be based on any k-linear assumption, and in particular under the eXternal Diffie Hellman XDH assumption our proofs are even competitive with Random-Oracle based \u03a3-protocol NIZK proofs. We also show that our system can be extended to include integer tags in the defining equations, where the tags are provided adaptively by the adversary. This leads to applicability of our system to many applications that use tags, e.g. applications using Cramer-Shoup projective hash proofs. Our techniques also lead to the shortest known ciphertext fully secure identity based encryption IBE scheme under standard static assumptions SXDH. Further, we also get a short publicly-verifiable CCA2-secure IBE scheme.",

In this paper, we describe a code compression algorithm based on arithmetic coding, discuss how to design decompression architecture, and illustrate the tradeoffs between compression ratio and decompression overhead, by using different probability models. Experimental results for a VLIW embedded processor TMS320C6x show that compression ratios between 67% and 80% can be achieved, depending on the probability models used.

        "abstract":"Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a popular feature extraction technique for face recognition. However, it often suffers from the small sample size problem when dealing with the high dimensional face data. Some approaches have been proposed to overcome this problem, but they are often unstable and have to discard some discriminative information. In this paper, a dual-space LDA approach for face recognition is proposed to take full advantage of the discriminative information in the face space. Based on a probabilistic visual model, the eigenvalue spectrum in the null space of within-class scatter matrix is estimated, and discriminant analysis is simultaneously applied in the principal and null subspaces of the within-class scatter matrix. The two sets of discriminative features are then combined for recognition. It outperforms existing LDA approaches.",

        "abstract":"Many fields rely on some stochastic sampling of a given complex space. Low-discrepancy sequences are methods aiming at producing samples with better space-filling properties than uniformly distributed random numbers, hence allowing a more efficient sampling of that space. State-of-the-art methods like nearly orthogonal Latin hypercubes and scrambled Halton sequences are configured by permutations of internal parameters, where permutations are commonly done randomly. This paper proposes the use of evolutionary algorithms to evolve these permutations, in order to optimize a discrepancy measure. Results show that an evolutionary method is able to generate low-discrepancy sequences of significantly better space-filling properties compared to sequences configured with purely random permutations.",

        "abstract":"Changes in the business environment and the advent of new Information Technologies (IT) create new challenges and opportunities for redesigning the organization. Organizational design encompasses a large number of factors including IT, incentives, business processes, and the scope of decision authority. Further, a design configuration based on a given business and technological environment may have to be modified with changes in the environment. We suggest using an approach called business value complementarity [8] as a systematic basis to ensure that design decisions contribute maximally to bottom-line performance measures such as profitability. It is based on the notion of creating a business value model showing relationships between key performance measures and design decision variables involving IT, incentives, etc. Complementarity between the variables in the business value model provides a basis for choosing the levels of design variables. We derive some results which specify conditions under which the overall performance measure(s) are complementary in the design variables. We suggest that a Decision Support System (DSS) would be appropriate for helping senior management in the complex process of developing and maintaining a business value model and in choosing a suitable organizational design. We also enumerate high level functional requirements of such a DSS.",

        "abstract":"This study aims to examine senior citizens' credibility assessment of online health information by using mixed methods consisting of a log analysis and focus groups. In particular, a log analysis will show \"which\" websites senior citizens often visit and stay at for a long time. In addition, focus groups will show \"why\" senior citizens use certain websites frequently and for how long. Based on the P-I Theory, this study will explain \"which\" markers (elements) of websites catch seniors' attention and \"why\" they perceive the websites to be credible. Considering credibility assessment is a research topic in the field of social sciences that cannot be fully understood by using either purely quantitative or purely qualitative techniques, mixed methods involving qualitative and quantitative data sources and analyses are a useful methodology. In addition, in light of the expected increase in the population of senior citizens and their great concern for and interest in health information, findings from the proposed study will provide important data only for researchers in this area but also librarians and system developers.",

        "abstract":"Arrowhead cursor shape may offer irrelevant cues that conflict with desired positioning movements. To assist cursor design this study considered how cursor shape can influence the preparation or execution of cursor positioning movements. An experiment varied cursor shape on-line such that its shape cued the required direction of movement or better afforded hitting the target. Twelve participants performed cursor positioning movements with systematic variations in cursor shape affecting preparation (neutral, pre-cuing target direction), cursor flight (arrowhead, comet) and terminal guidance (big, small target). Kinematic analysis determined the effects on phases of cursor placement. Cursor shape primarily affected terminal guidance and implies conventional cursor designs should be reconsidered.",

        "abstract":"Addressing dynamics and notifications in the Semantic Web realm has recently become an important area of research. Run time data is continuously generated by multiple social networks, sensor networks, various on-line services and so forth. How to get advantage of this continuously arriving data events remains a challenge --that is, how to integrate heterogeneous event streams, combine them with background knowledge e.g., an ontology, and perform event processing and stream reasoning. In this paper we describe ETALIS --a system which enables specification and monitoring of changes in near real time. Changes can be specified as complex event patterns, and ETALIS can detect them in real time. Moreover the system can perform reasoning over streaming events with respect to background knowledge. ETALIS implements two languages for specification of event patterns: ETALIS Language for Events, and Event Processing SPARQL. ETALIS has various applicabilities in capturing changes in semantic networks, broadcasting notifications to interested parties, and creating further changes based on processing of the temporal, static, or slowly evolving knowledge.",

        "abstract":"This paper defines a highly concurrent, software rapid prototyping process that supports a sizable development team to develop a high-quality, evolutionary software prototype. The process is particularly aimed at developing user-interface intensive, workflow-centered software. The Software Engineering Department and User Interface Design Center at Siemens Corporate Research (SCR) have successfully practiced this process in prototyping a healthcare information system over the last year. We have evolved this agile, iterative software development process that tightly integrates the UI designers and the software developers with the prototype users (e.g., marketing staff), leading to efficient development of business application prototypes with mature user interfaces. We present the details of our process and the conditions that make it effective. Our experience with this process indicates that prototypes can be rapidly developed in a highly concurrent fashion given a stable prototyping software architecture and access to readily available domain knowledge.",

        "abstract":"We present an object-level metric for segmentation performance which was developed to quantify both over- and under-segmentation errors, as well as to penalize segmentations with larger deviations in object shape. This metric is applied to the problem of segmentation of cell nuclei in routinely stained H&E histopathology imagery. We show the correspondence between the metric terms and qualitative observations of segmentation quality, particularly the presence of over- and under-segmentation. The computation of this metric does not require the use of any point-to-point or region-to-region correspondences but rather simple computations using the object mask from both the segmentation and ground truth.",

We assumed that co-speech gestures favor the construction of a complete mental representation of the discourse content, and we tested the predictions that a discourse accompanied by gestures, as compared with a discourse not accompanied by gestures, should result in better recollection of conceptual information, a greater number of discourse-based inferences drawn from the information explicitly stated in the discourse, and poorer recognition of verbatim of the discourse. The results of three experiments confirmed these predictions.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents a new approach for reconstructing images mapped or painted on straight uniform generalized cylinders (SUGC). A set of monocular images is taken from different viewpoints in order to be mosaiced and to represent the entire scene in detail. The expressions of the SUGC's projection axis are derived from two cross-sections projected onto the image plane. Based on these axes we derive the SUGC localization in the camera coordinate system. We explain how we can find a virtual image representation when the intersection of the two axes is matched to the image center. We analyze the perspective distortions when flattening a scene which is mapped on a SUGC. We evaluate the lower and the upper bounds of the necessary number of views in order to represent the entire scene from a SUGC, by considering the distortions produced by perspective projection. A region matching based mosaicing method is proposed to be applied on the flattened images in order to obtain the complete scene. The mosaiced scene is visualized on a new synthetic surface by a mapping procedure. The proposed algorithm is used for the representation of mural paintings located on SUGCs with closed cross-sections (circles for columns), or opened cross-sections (ellipses or parabolas for vaults).",

In the case of 10% H\"2 concentration, Young's Modulus and hardness were obtained as 367 and 36GPa, respectively. The surface roughness according to H\"2 concentrations was investigated by AFM (atomic force microscope). When H\"2 concentration was 10%, the roughness of 3C-SiC thins was 9.92nm, which is also the best of them. Therefore, in order to apply poly 3C-SiC thin films to MEMS (micro-electromechanical system) applications, H\"2 concentration's rate should increase to obtain better mechanical properties and surface roughness.",

        "abstract":"In this paper the problem of path following control of autonomous vehicles subject to sliding is addressed. First a kinematic model is built which takes sliding effects into account by introducing two additional tire sliding angles. Since the tire sliding angles cannot be directly measured by sensors, an adaptive robust Luenberger observer is designed. With this observer, the tire cornering stiffness instead of the sliding angles is identified in presence of time-varying lateral disturbance. The Lyapunov stability theory guarantees that the estimated cornering stiffness would converge to a neighborhood of the real value when control inputs excitated the system persistently. But due to the existence of the lateral disturbance which causes loss of accuracy of the sliding angle reconstruction, the previously designed anti-sliding controller whose effectiveness completely depends on the estimation of the sliding angles cannot yield satisfactory results. To overcome this problem a tire-oriented kinematic model is built in which the inaccuracy of the sliding angle reconstruction is modeled in form of additive disturbances to the kinematic model. By transforming the tire-oriented kinematic model into a perturbed chained system, a sliding mode controller, which is robust to both the sliding effects and the negative effects of the lateral disturbance is designed with the help of the natural algebraic structure of the chained systems. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can provide accurate estimation of the sliding angles and guarantee high anti-sliding control accuracy even in presence of time-varying lateral disturbance.",

        "abstract":"The power factor is a very important process variable in ac resistance spot welding (RSW) operation. Because of the variation of welding load during the welding process, the power factor is a time-varying variable. The power factor of RSW cannot be obtained online because the value of power factor angle cannot be directly measured in real time. After analyzing the electrical structure of RSW, a new algorithm for measuring the power factor angle in real time is developed. Then, an integrated algorithm for calculating the power factor on a practical discrete system in real time is proposed. Experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can be used to obtain more accurate values of the power factor angle than using other methods over a very large operation range. The final results of power factors obtained from the proposed algorithm are very close to the results from the numerical simulation.",

A strategy is elaborated which mainly uses standard home automation sensors. The solution is based on the transformation of sensor signals by automata and fuzzy rules to detect safety-or health-critical situations. The role of comfort as an enabling factor is also described. A real pilot project to implement the solution is specified.",

        "abstract":"The purpose of this study is the dimensioning of the cylindrical mixing chamber of a compressible fluid ejector used in particular in sugar refineries for degraded vapor re-compression at the calandria exit, during the evaporation phase. The method used, known as the \"integral\" or \"thermodynamic model\", is based on the model of the one-dimensional isentropic flow of perfect gases with the addition of a model of losses. Characteristic curves and envelope curves are plotted. The latter are an interesting tool from which the characteristic dimensions of the ejector can be rapidly obtained for preliminary dimensioning (for an initial contact with a customer for example). These ejectors, which were specifically designed for the process rather than selected from a catalog of standard devices, will promote energy saving.",

It is shown that the chamfer distances calculated within a set are the same as those calculated in the whole space if and only if the set is convex in each of the local distance directions. The result does not hold when the local distances allow more general geodesics. The results for chamfer metrics are related to corresponding results for the metrics generated by the two-, three- and four-direction graphs studied by Melter and Tomescu.",

        "abstract":"Feet-ground interactions influence the legged robot's stability. In this paper, a high-resolution indirect force measure- ment for hydraulic-legged robots is presented. The use of pres- sure transducers placed at one or both chambers of the robot's double-effect hydraulic actuators is investigated, and conclusions are drawn regarding their capability for indirectly measuring the contact forces between the feet and the ground. Because of the nonlinear dynamic properties of hydraulic cylinders, friction modeling is essential to determine at all times the true forces of each foot against the soil. The test case is called ROBOCLIMBER, which is a bulky quadruped climbing and walking machine able to carry heavy-duty drilling equipment for landslide consolidation and monitoring works. Sensor calibration and signal filtering requirements are also taken into consideration. To end, the overall proposed approach to measure feet-ground interactions is experi- mentally evaluated.",

        "abstract":"We present an image-based technique to relight real objects illuminated by a 4D incident light field, representing the illumination of an environment. By exploiting the richness in angular and spatial variation of the light field, objects can be relit with a high degree of realism.We record photographs of an object, illuminated from various positions and directions, using a projector mounted on a gantry as a moving light source. The resulting basis images are used to create a subset of the full reflectance field of the object. Using this reflectance field, we can create an image of the object, relit with any incident light field and observed from a flxed camera position.To maintain acceptable recording times and reduce the amount of data, we propose an efficient data acquisition method.Since the object can be relit with a 4D incident light field, illumination effects encoded in the light field, such as shafts of shadow or spot light effects, can be realized.",

        "abstract":"Self-organizing teams have been recognized and studied in various forms\u2014as autonomous groups in socio-technical systems, enablers of organizational theories, agents of knowledge management, and as examples of complex-adaptive systems. Over the last decade, self-organizing teams have taken center stage in software engineering when they were incorporated as a hallmark of Agile methods. Despite the long and rich history of self-organizing teams and their recent popularity with Agile methods, there has been little research on the topic within software wngineering. Particularly, there is a dearth of research on how Agile teams organize themselves in practice. Through a Grounded Theory research involving 58 Agile practitioners from 23 software organizations in New Zealand and India over a period of four years, we identified informal, implicit, transient, and spontaneous roles that make Agile teams self-organizing. These roles\u2014Mentor, Coordinator, Translator, Champion, Promoter, and Terminator\u2014are focused toward providing initial guidance and encouraging continued adherence to Agile methods, effectively managing customer expectations and coordinating customer collaboration, securing and sustaining senior management support, and identifying and removing team members threatening the self-organizing ability of the team. Understanding these roles will help software development teams and their managers better comprehend and execute their roles and responsibilities as a self-organizing team.",

        "abstract":"Conventional 2D touch-based interaction methods for handheld Augmented Reality (AR) cannot provide intuitive 3D interaction due to a lack of natural gesture input with real-time depth information. The goal of this research is to develop a natural interaction technique for manipulating virtual objects in 3D space on handheld AR devices. We present a novel method that is based on identifying the positions and movements of the user's fingertips, and mapping these gestures onto corresponding manipulations of the virtual objects in the AR scene. We conducted a user study to evaluate this method by comparing it with a common touch-based interface under different AR scenarios. The results indicate that although our method takes longer time, it is more natural and enjoyable to use.",

        "abstract":"Current technological developments and application-driven demands are bringing us closer to the realization of au- tonomous multirobot systems performing increasingly com- plex missions. However, existing methods of distributing mis- sion subcomponents among multirobot teams do not explicitly handle the required complexity and instead treat tasks as sim- ple indivisible entities, ignoring any inherent structure and se- mantics that such complex tasks might have. These task prop- erties can be exploited to produce more efficient team plans by giving individual robots the ability to come up with new, more localized ways to perform a task; by allowing multiple robots to cooperate by sharing the subcomponents of a task; or both. In this paper, we describe the complex task allocation prob- lem and present a distributed solution for efficiently allocating a set of complex tasks among a robot team. Complex tasks are tasks that can be solved in many possi- ble ways. In contrast, simple tasks can be accomplished in a straightforward, prescriptive manner. The current scope of our work is currently limited to complex tasks that can be de- composed into multiple subtasks related by Boolean logic op- erators. Our solution to multirobot coordination for complex tasks extends market-based approaches by generalizing task descriptions into task trees, which allows tasks to be traded in a market setting at variable levels of abstraction. In order to incorporate these task structures into a market mechanism, novel and efficient bidding and auction clearing algorithms are required. As an example scenario, we focus on an area recon- naissance problem which requires sensor coverage by a team of robots over a set of defined areas of interest. The advan- tages of explicitly modeling complex tasks during the alloca- tion process is demonstrated by a comparison of our approach with existing task allocation algorithms in this application do-",

Due to the high speed a vehicle can reach, this application field requires a very precise real-time response. After a brief description of the ARGO autonomous vehicle, the paper focuses on the requirements of this kind of application: the use of only visual information, the use of low-cost hardware, and the need for real-time processing. The paper then presents the way these problems have been solved using MMX technology, discusses some optimization techniques that have been successfully employed, and compares the results with the ones of a traditional scalar code.",

        "abstract":"Fluid flow approximation allows efficient analysis of large scale PEPA models. Given a model, this method outputs how the mean, variance, and any other moment of the model's stochastic behaviour evolves as a function of time. We investigate whether the method's results, i.e. moments of the behaviour, are sufficient to capture system's actual dynamics. We ran a series of experiments on a client-server model. For some parametrizations of the model, the model's behaviour can accurately be characterized by the fluid flow approximations of its moments. However, the experiments show that for some other parametrizations, these moments are not sufficient to capture the model's behaviour, highlighting a pitfall of relying only on the results of fluid flow analysis. The results suggest that the sufficiency of the fluid flow method for the analysis of a model depends on the model's concrete parametrization. They also make it clear that the existing criteria for deciding on the sufficiency of the fluid flow method are not robust.",

        "abstract":"The continued reliance of manual data capture in engineering asset intensive organisations highlights the critical role played by those responsible for recording raw data. The potential for data quality variance across individual operators also exposes the need to better manage this particular group. This paper evaluates the relative importance of the human factors associated with data quality. Using the theory of planned behaviour this paper considers the impact of attitudes, perceptions and behavioural intentions on the data collection process in an engineering asset context. Two additional variables are included, those of time pressure and operator feedback. Time pressure is argued to act as a moderator between intention and data collection behaviour, while perceived behavioural control will moderate the relationship between feedback and data collection behaviour. Overall the paper argues that the presence of best practice procedures or threats of disciplinary sanction are insufficient controls to determine data quality. Instead those concerned with improving the data collection performance of operators should consider the operator's perceptions of group attitude towards data quality, the level of feedback provided to data collectors and the impact of time pressures on procedure compliance. A range of practical recommendations are provided to those wishing to improve the quality of their manually acquired data.",

        "abstract":"Introducing workflow management technology in healthcare seems to be prospective in dealing with the problem that the current healthcare Information Systems cannot provide sufficient support for the process management, although several challenges still exist. The purpose of this paper is to study the method of developing workflow-based information system in radiology department as a use case.First, a workflow model of typical radiology process was established. Second, based on the model, the system could be designed and implemented as a group of loosely coupled components. Each component corresponded to one task in the process and could be assembled by the workflow management system. The legacy systems could be taken as special components, which also corresponded to the tasks and were integrated through transferring non-work- flow-aware interfaces to the standard ones. Finally, a workflow dashboard was designed and implemented to provide an integral view of radiology processes.The workflow-based Radiology Information System was deployed in the radiology department of Zhejiang Chinese Medicine Hospital in China. The results showed that it could be adjusted flexibly in response to the needs of changing process, and enhance the process management in the department. It can also provide a more workflow-aware integration method, comparing with other methods such as IHE-based ones.The workflow-based approach is a new method of developing radiology information system with more flexibility, more functionalities of process management and more workflow-aware integration. The work of this paper is an initial endeavor for introducing workflow management technology in healthcare.",

        "abstract":"A new area of biological research is identifying and grouping patterns of behaviour in wild animals by analysing data obtained through the attachment of tri-axial accelerometers. As these recording devices become smaller and less expensive their use has increased. Currently acceleration data are visualised as 2D time series plots, and analyses are based on summary statistics and the application of Fourier transforms. We develop alternate visualisations of this data so as to analyse, explore and present new patterns of animal behaviour. Our visualisations include interactive spherical scatterplots, spherical histograms, clustering methods, and feature-based state diagrams of the data. We study the application of these visualisation methods to accelerometry data from animal movement. The reaction of biologists to these visualisations is also reported.",

        "abstract":"Digital watermarking refers to the process of embedding a digital code into an image, video, printed document or audio media. The code should not interfere with the normal use of the media but can be recovered later. With the growing interest in haptic interactions for training and museum displays, it is only a matter of time that haptic digital media become available on the internet. For example, one will soon be able to feel the shape of Michaelangelo\u00fds David or Japan\u00fds Big Buddha by downloading a file that can be \"played\" on a force-feedback device. The haptic file may contain surface texture data in addition to topography so that David feels like marble and Big Buddha wood. In the meanwhile, the need for haptic digital watermarking will arise for protecting haptic media contents. This paper introduces for the first time the idea of haptic watermarking and shows one way to embed a watermark into a host surface texture signal. We also demonstrate the imperceptibility of the texture watermark in a psychophysical experiment.",

This system features on-the-fly transcoding on streaming web data with negligible overhead, maximum data reuse among different transcoded versions of a web object, and the optimal bandwidth usage between the proxy and the server. The importance of the system reflects not only in its feasibility in implementation but also in its matching with the new HTTP protocol support for partial object retrieval and the emerging new multimedia data formats such as JPEG2000 and MPEG4.",

        "abstract":"This paper studies the output convergence of a class of recurrent neural networks with time-varying inputs. The model of the studied neural networks has different dynamic structure from that in the well known Hopfield model, it does not contain linear terms. Since different structures of differential equations usually result in quite different dynamic behaviors, the convergence of this model is quite different from that of Hopfield model. This class of neural networks has been found many successful applications in solving some optimization problems. Some sufficient conditions to guarantee output convergence of the networks are derived.",

The prototype is oriented toward a secure ubiquitous home environment but can be extended to other similar scenarios. Our approach is based on reducing data redundancy while maintaining node redundancy for reliability and providing at the same time basic security services without sacrificing a considerable amount of resources. We further show that our approach is energy-efficient compared with the capture\u2013send approach used traditionally. More importantly, through our experiences in the real-world deployment of the system we also provide a roadmap for the development of efficient voice-based smart home applications.

TELOS aims to provide an open operating system in which users can develop and use eLearning and knowledge management resources and environments within a service-oriented and ontology-driven framework. A special emphasis is put on the aggregation of resources through a graphic scenario editor and the referencing of the resources using a knowledge and competency representation. We advocate that this approach is necessary for federated search or harvesting tools to be well integrated and find meaningful learning resources that need to be repurposed and aggregated, taking in account the diversity of technologies, pedagogical intent and referencing schemas.",

        "abstract":"We present a novel approach for interactive content-aware image resizing. The resizing is performed on warping a triangular mesh over the image, which captures the image saliency information as well as the underlying image features. The warped triangular mesh and the horizontal and vertical scales of all triangles are simultaneously obtained by a quadratic optimization which can be achieved by solving a sparse linear system. Our approach can preserve the shapes of curved features in the resized images. The resizing operation can be performed in an interactive rate which makes the proposed approach practically useful for realtime image resizing. To guarantee a foldover free resizing result, we modify the optimization to a standard quadratic programming. A number of experimental results have shown that our approach has obtained pleasing results and outperforms the previous approaches.",

The presented approach builds on user and resource profiles, which are continuously refined so as to allow estimates on the completion time of user tasks in specific grid resources. As shown in our simulation results, our approach reduces the average completion time of tasks by balancing the processing load on the grid resources, while allowing the detection of faults during task execution, and the reservation of grid resources in advance.

        "abstract":"Authenticated Key Establishment (AKE) protocols enable two entities, say a client (or a user) and a server, to share common session keys in an authentic way. In this paper, we review AKE protocols from a little bit different point of view, i.e. the relationship between information a client needs to possess (for authentication) and immunity to the respective leakage of stored secrets from a client side and a server side. Since the information leakage would be more conceivable than breaking down the underlying cryptosystems, it is desirable to enhance the immunity to the leakage. First and foremost, we categorize AKE protocols according to how much resilience against the leakage can be provided. Then, we propose new AKE protocols that have immunity to the leakage of stored secrets from a client and a server (or servers), respectively. And we extend our protocols to be possible for updating secret values registered in server(s) or password remembered by a client.",

We introduce a modified upper bound and a modified power allocation strategy for the previous asymptotic optimal singular value decomposition zero-forcing beamforming (SVD-ZFBF) [2] at first. And then the effect of channel estimation error to SVDZFBF would be discussed. Similar with the full channel side information (CSI) case, SVD-ZFBF can approach the modified upper bound in the large user number case, no matter how large the channel estimation error is. And in the limited user number case, increasing relay station (RS) power would not make SVD-ZFBF approach the upper bound, which is different from the full CSI case. There is a capacity gap, which is mainly related to the channel estimation error from RS to users, between SVD-ZFBF and the upper bound.",

        "abstract":"We study the problem of pricing uplink power in wide-band cognitive radio networks under the objective of revenue maximization for the service provider and while ensuring incentive compatibility for the users. User utility is modeled as a concave function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the base station, and the problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game. Namely, the service provider imposes differentiated prices per unit of transmitting power and the users consequently update their power levels to maximize their net utilities. We devise a pricing policy and give conditions for its optimality when all the users are to be accommodated in the network. We show that there exist infinitely many Nash equilibrium points that reward the service provider with the same revenue. The pricing policy charges more from users that have better channel conditions and more willingness to pay for the provided service. We then study properties of the optimal revenue with respect to different parameters in the network. We show that for regimes with symmetric users who share the same level of willingness to pay, the optimal revenue is concave and increasing in the number of users in the network. We analytically obtain achievable SNRs for this special case, and finally present a numerical study in support of our results.",

Our main aim is to generalize the Legendre operational matrices of derivatives and integrals to the three dimensional case. By the use of these operational matrices, we reduce the corresponding fractional order partial differential equations to a system of easily solvable algebraic equations. The method is applied to solve several problems. The results we obtain are compared with the exact solutions and we find that the error is negligible.",

        "abstract":"A relative bandwidth service differentiation scheme is pro- posed for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). The service profile for a traffic session is defined as a relative target rate, which is a fraction of the effective link capacity of nodes. To calculate the effective link ca- pacity of nodes in a randomly moving topology MANET, two methods are presented: one is parameter based and the other is measurement based. Simulation results show that the parameter based and measure- ment based calculations work effectively to estimate the effective link ca- pacity of nodes and the relative service differentiation is consistent. Fur- thermore, the differentiation is more consistent when nodes use the mea- surement based calculation of link capacity because it is more accurate.",

        "abstract":"The minmax in repeated games with imperfect monitoring can differ from the minmax of those games with perfect monitoring when two or more players are able to gain common information known only to themselves, and utilize this information at a later stage. Gossner and Tomala showed that in a class of such games, the minmax is given by a weighted average of the payoffs of two main strategies: one in which the information is gained, and the other in which the information is utilized. However, all examples analyzed to date require only one main strategy in which information is created and utilized simultaneously. We show that two strategies are indeed needed by providing and solving a concrete example of a three-player game.",

        "abstract":"Automated accurate and consistent sulcal parcellation of longitudinal cortical surfaces is of great importance in studying longitudinal morphological and functional changes of human brains, since longitudinal cortical changes are normally very subtle, especially in aging brains. However, applying the existing methods (which were typically developed for cortical sulcal parcellation of a single cortical surface) independently to longitudinal cortical surfaces might generate longitudinally-inconsistent results. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a novel energy function based method for accurate and consistent sulcal parcellation of longitudinal cortical surfaces. Specifically, both spatial and temporal smoothness are imposed in the energy function to obtain consistent longitudinal sulcal parcellation results. The energy function is efficiently minimized by a graph cut method. The proposed method has been successfully applied to sulcal parcellation of both real and simulated longitudinal inner cortical surfaces of human brain MR images. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.",

        "abstract":"Many problems are difficult to adequately explore until a prototype exists in order to elicit user feedback. One such problem is a system that automatically categorizes and manages email. Due to a myriad of user interface issues, a prototype is necessary to determine what techniques and technologies are effective in the email domain. This paper describes the implementation of an add-in for Microsoft Outlook 2000 TM that intends to address two problems with email: 1) help manage the inbox by automatically classifying email based on user folders, and 2) to aid in search and retrieval by providing a list of email relevant to the selected item. This add-in represents a first step in an experimental system for the study of other issues related to information management. The system has been set up to allow experimentation with other classification algorithms and the source code is available online in an effort to promote further experimentation.",

By a geometrical approach the problem of computing the diameter of a multiple-loop network (with k hops) is transformed to an equivalent problem in the integer lattice Zk. In the special case of double-loop networks this leads to an algorithm with running time O(log n). This is an undirected analogue to the result of Cheng and Hwang, who recently found an O(log n) algorithm for computing diameters of directed double-loop networks.",

        "abstract":"The paper considers the impact of the UMTS synchronisation channel (SCH) on bearer performance. The SCH is described, and it is shown that it has significantly different characteristics from other interference and noise sources. For this reason, it is important to understand whether it can be generally modelled in a simple way, e.g. by using its average received power. In reality, it is found that this is not the case, and that the performance degrades when the SCH is present for the same average level of Eb\/Nt. This shows that the coding\/interleaving schemes used are not sufficient to average the temporally selective interference. In particular, it is found that convolutionally coded bearers show higher sensitivity than turbo coded ones, resulting in an increase in the Eb\/Nt targets set by the outer loop. A basic analysis indicates that the resulting system capacity loss is not significant. However, a full evaluation of this effect is going to require a more complex analysis based on system simulation.",

        "abstract":"The SANY IP consortium (http:\/\/www.sany-ip.eu) has recently developed several interesting service prototypes that extend the usability of the Open Geospatial Consortium \"Sensor Web Enablement\" (OGC SWE) architecture. One such service prototype, developed by the Austrian Research Centers, is the \"cascading SOS\" (SOS-X). SOS-X is a client to the underlying OGC Sensor Observation service(s) (SOS). It provides alternative access routes to users (or services) interested in accessing data. In addition to a simple cascading, SOS-X can re-format, re-organize, and merge data from several sources into a single SOS offering. Thanks to the built-in \"Formula 3\" prototype, a kind of time series library, SOS-X will be enabled to derive new data sets on the fly executing arbitrary algebraic operations on one or more data input streams. This article will discuss the SOS-X development status (focusing at end of 2008), further development agenda in year 2009, and possibilities for using the SOS-X outside of the SANY IP.",

        "abstract":"In the efforts to fight piracy of high-valued media content, forensic digital watermarking as a passive content security scheme is a potential alternative to current, restrictive approaches like DRM. In this paper, we present a novel watermarking scheme for videos based on affine geometric transformations. Frames can be modified in an imperceptible manner by applying a small, global rotation, translation, or zooming, which can be detected later on by comparison with the originals. To compensate geometric distortions that have been introduced while a video travels down legal as well as illegal distribution chains, a spatio-temporal synchronization is performed using our video registration toolkit application. To evaluate our approach, we compare it with several other schemes regarding the robustness against common attacks, including camcorder capture.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we describe a system for detecting encephalography (EEG) signatures of visual recognition events evoked in a single trial during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). In order to investigate the viability of nonlinear approaches in EEG detection and assess the performance comparison, we applied three classifiers (linear logistic regression model, Laplacian classifier, and spectral maximum mutual information projection) in the detection tasks. The EEG was recorded using 32 electrodes during the rapid image presentation (50ms\/100ms per image). Subjects were instructed to push a button when they recognize a target image. The results suggest that while the detection of single trial EEG- based recognition is possible, taking advantage of the nonlinear techniques requires data representation that would overcome the non-stationarity of the EEG signals.",

It is shown how it is possible to spied up the self-consistent cycle (iteration) characterizing one of the most well-known DFT implementations: FLAPW. Generating the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices and solving the associated generalized eigenproblems Ax = lambda Bx constitute the two most time-consuming fractions of each iteration. Two promising directions, implementing the new methodology, are presented that will ultimately improve the performance of the generalized eigensolver and save computational time.",

        "abstract":"The problem of robust global exponential stability is investigated for a class of stochastic uncertain discrete-time recurrent neural networks with time delay. In this paper, the midpoint of the time delay's variation interval is introduced, and the variation interval is divided into two subintervals. Then, by constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and checking its variation in the two subintervals, respectively, some novel delay-dependent stability criteria for the addressed neural networks are derived. Numerical examples are provided to show that the achieved conditions are less conservative than some existing ones in the literature.",

If digital libraries are viewed as both social and technological artifacts, then effective de- sign requires that we must understand the social world in which each functions. The theoretical framework of Pierre Bourdieu and the situated action approach are suggested as sound bases for this understanding. Initial findings of our work in the arena of watershed planning, as part of the UC Berkeley Digital Library Project, are reported.",

        "abstract":"In an energy harvester powered wireless sensor node, the energy harvester is often the only energy source, therefore it is crucial to configure the microcontroller and the sensor node so that the harvested energy is used efficiently. This paper presents a response surface model (RSM) based design space exploration and optimisation of a complete wireless sensor node system. In our work the power consumption models of the microcontroller and the sensor node are defined based on their digital operations so that the parameters of the digital algorithms can be optimised to achieve the best energy efficiency. In the proposed technique, SystemC-A is used to model the system's analogue components as well as the digital control algorithms implemented in the microcontroller and the sensor node. A series of simulations are carried out and a response surface model is constructed from the simulation results. The RSM is then optimised using MATLAB's optimisation toolbox and the results show that the optimised system configuration can double the total number of wireless transmissions with fixed amount of harvested energy. The great improvement in the system performance validates the efficiency of our technique.",

        "abstract":"One of the contemporary problems, and at the same time a big opportunity, in business networks of supply chains are the issues associated with the vast amounts of data arising there. The data may be utilized by the decision support systems in logistics; nevertheless, often there is an information integration problem. The problems with information interchange are related to issues with exchange between independently designed data systems. The networked supply chains will need appropriate IT architectures to support the cooperating business units utilizing structured and unstructured big data and the mechanisms to integrate data in heterogeneous supply chains. In this paper we analyze the capabilities of the big data technology architectures with cloud computing under usage of Linked Data in business process management in supply chains to cope with unstructured near-time data and data silos problems. We present our approach on a 4PL (Fourth-party Logistics) integrator business process example.",

        "abstract":"Coming from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Semantic Web (SW) circles, ontologies are used mainly to represent domains. The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) field gave birth to Domain Specific Languages to represent a particular technical domain. Abstracting from their uses, we consider as many others researchers that ontologies and models are closer than their original fields could get to think. Furthermore, their building or development are facing the same problems. They are costly and need experts' interviews in order to grasp specific knowledge and structure it. Likewise, ontologies and DSL can benefit from each other domains in reusing construction methodologies and even reusing knowledge modelled in another format. In this paper we first present the ontologies and DSL definition we use and some methodologies of development enabling the reuse of knowledge (as alignment, fusion). We then present how we propose to reuse the knowledge of a robotic ontology to develop robotic DSLs within the PROTEUS project in order to inject readymade domain information to the DSL.",

Thus, energy efficiency improvement is an important way to reduce these costs and to increase predictable earnings, especially in times of high energy price volatility. This work describes the development of an expert system for the improvement of this efficiency of the reaction zone of a petrochemical plant. This system has been developed after a data mining process of the variables registered in the plant. Besides, a kernel of neural networks has been embedded in the expert system. A graphical environment integrating the proposed system was developed in order to test the system. With the application of the expert system, the energy saving on the applied zone would have been about 20%.",

        "abstract":"Feedback-directed optimization (FDO) is effective in improving application runtime performance, but has not been widely adopted due to the tedious dual-compilation model, the difficulties in generating representative training data sets, and the high runtime overhead of profile collection. The use of hardware-event sampling to generate estimated edge profiles overcomes these drawbacks. Yet, hardware event samples are typically not precise at the instruction or basic-block granularity. These inaccuracies lead to missed performance when compared to instrumentation-based FDO@. In this paper, we use multiple hardware event profiles and supervised learning techniques to generate heuristics for improved precision of basic-block-level sample profiles, and to further improve the smoothing algorithms used to construct edge profiles. We demonstrate that sampling-based FDO can achieve an average of 78% of the performance gains obtained using instrumentation-based exact edge profiles for SPEC2000 benchmarks, matching or beating instrumentation-based FDO in many cases. The overhead of collection is only 0.74% on average, while compiler based instrumentation incurs 6.8%-53.5% overhead (and 10x overhead on an industrial web search application), and dynamic instrumentation incurs 28.6%-1639.2% overhead.",

        "abstract":"  This paper establishes the normalisation of natural deduction or lambda calculus formulation of Intuitionistic Non Commutative Logic --- which involves both commutative and non commutative connectives. This calculus first introduced by de Groote and as opposed to the classical version by Abrusci and Ruet admits a full entropy which allow order to be relaxed into any suborder. Our result also includes, as a special case, the normalisation of natural deduction the Lambek calculus with product, which is unsurprising but yet unproved. Regarding Intuitionistic Non Commutative Logic with full entropy does not have up to now a proof net syntax, and that for linguistic applications, sequent calculi which are only more or less equivalent to natural deduction, are not convenient because they lack the standard Curry-Howard isomorphism.

        "abstract":"We present the software library libCreme which we have previously used to successfully calculate convex-roof entanglement measures of mixed quantum states appearing in realistic physical systems. Evaluating the amount of entanglement in such states is in general a non-trivial task requiring to solve a highly non-linear complex optimization problem. The algorithms provided here are able to achieve to do this for a large and important class of entanglement measures. The library is mostly written in the Matlab programming language, but is fully compatible to the free and open-source Octave platform. Some inefficient subroutines are written in C\/C++ for better performance. This manuscript discusses the most important theoretical concepts and workings of the algorithms, focusing on the actual implementation and usage within the library. Detailed examples in the end should make it easy for the user to apply libCreme to specific problems.",

        "abstract":"The effect on multiskill call-center performance of pooling dependent call types is investigated. For this purpose, a copula-based modeling approach is used to provide multivariate models that take into account the call types' asymmetric dependence structures found in empirical data. Then, the realistic input models of the call-type-dependent arrival processes are used in a simulation study to explore the sensitivity of the pooling decision to this dependence. We find that the widely used assumption of independence, as well as the misspecification of the dependence structure, can lead to substantial misestimation of call-center performance. This demonstrates the importance of modeling call-type dependence in stochastic simulation studies of call centers. We also show, through case studies, that pooling two asymmetric left-tail-dependent call types is more likely to lead to low agents occupancy; whereas the presence of right-tail dependence structure increases the risk of service-level shortfall. This work provides new managerial insights to improve decision making in determining which call types to merge in the same pool in multiskill call centers.",

        "abstract":"Business and government leaders seem to agree that the efficient running of the Information Superhighway will require accurate identification of humans. Indeed, the evolution of information technology for decades has sought to develop perfect identity of human subjects. The architects of modern information systems believe that with perfect identity lies the hope of perfect efficiency. Conversely, privacy advocates argue that perfect identity is the single most important condition for the establishment of a controlled society. And such a condition is anathema to civil rights. This short article explores the civil liberty and privacy issues that arise in the context of biometric-based identification.",

        "abstract":"Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures and three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) have been introduced as attractive options for overcoming the barriers in interconnect scaling while increasing the number of cores. Combining these two approaches is expected to yield better performance and higher scalability. This paper explores the possibility of combining these two techniques in a heterogeneity aware fashion. We explore how heterogeneous processors can be mapped onto the given 3D chip area to minimize the data access costs. Our initial results indicate that the proposed approach generates promising results within tolerable solution times.",

The system's interaction capabilities help to deal with the challenges of performing context detection with very limited computing resources. These capabilities and the system as such were in general approved by the users. The proposed domain-specific context model supports individual and collective work by objects, so that each collective can fulfil its task independently and needs to communicate with the mobile device only to receive a task and present the results.",

        "abstract":"Recent trends in the pharmaceutical sector are changing the way processes are designed and executed, moving from: allowing the process to operate in a fixed point, to: allowing a permissible region in the operating space (a.k.a. design-space). This trend is driving product development to design quality into the manufacturing process (Quality by Design) and not to rely solely on testing quality in the product. These changes address the presence of uncertainties entering the process and their negative effect on product quality if the operating conditions are not free to compensate for these disturbances. This work provides a review of methods to address the presence of these uncertainties, ranging from the establishment of multivariate specifications for incoming product, to feed-forward process control. It also presents the development of a feed-forward controller to compensate the process for the observed changes in the properties of the incoming material. The development and testing of this controller is illustrated with a wet-granulation process. The performance of the multiple control strategies is back-propagated to the changes in the acceptance regions for the raw materials. Ultimately, the controller and its model are used to define an integrated design-space that accounts for the network of complex relationships between materials, process conditions and product. This work proposes and demonstrates that the use of mathematics is the only way to reach the maximum potential of the Quality by Design by providing a tool to specify an integral Design Space.",

Mapping information can be managed in a distributed rather than a centralised way. Organizations can publish their MIXER mapping or preferred gateway routing information using just local resources (their local DNS server), avoiding the need for a strong coordination with any centralised organization.

        "abstract":"Several feature-preserving two-class clustering methods are investigated in this paper. By preserving certain features of the input data, some formulas useful in calculating the two class representatives and population percentages are derived. The derived formulas are expressed in general forms suitable for any dimensionality higher than two. The complexities of the investigated methods are all of order N if the data size is N and hence are much faster than any other clustering method which uses N x N dissimilarity matrix. Additionally, all investigated methods use no initial guesses. Experimental results are included to make a comparison among the four investigated methods so that only two methods are recommended. Further comparisons with the k-means method and hierarchical clustering methods also are included. The proposed feature-preserving approach was found to be fast, automatic and suitable for any field requiring fast high-dimensional two-class clustering.",

        "abstract":"Using IP anycast, connectionless services such as DNS can be decentralized to cope with high service request rates. Unfortunately, most Internet services cannot take direct advantage of anycast addressing because they rely on stateful communications. Subsequent packets of the same session may be routed to a different anycast group member, resulting in a broken service. Therefore, we introduce a transparent layer-3 architecture that provides anycast support for stateful services. Taking into account user demands, available resources, extra network overhead and anycast infrastructure costs, we address optimal proxy router placement and infrastructure dimensioning, an issue that has not been tackled before for similar architectures. Simulation results indicate that even modest overlay infrastructures, consisting of a small number of proxy routers, often result in an effective stateful anycast solution where the detour via the proxy routers is negligible.",

A Profile Aggregator (PA), which manages various kinds of user-related information in the form of a \"Personalized Profile\", is proposed as one of the key components in our proposed framework. In the PA, a piece of information is connected to other related information and this info-linkage facilitates the retrieval of detailed information easily. The PA also has a role in terms of disseminating a subset of Personalized Profile, including a query interface, trigger interface and access control mechanism.",

        "abstract":"NELIAC systems for several different machines have been generated using the original NELIAC system developed at the Naval Electronics Laboratory, San Diego, in 1958. A basic \u201cbootstrap\u201d process was used to generate all but the first, i.e., the systems were described in the NELIAC language and generated by an existing NELIAC compiler. This experience proved there was no inherent difficulty in \u201cbuilding compilers with compilers;\u201d indeed, it pointed out many advantages in using a POL for constructing programming systems. This report presents the results of a project completed in April, 1961, in which the NELIAC system was used to generate a compiler for the IBM 1401. The 1401 compiler, which runs on the 7090 and produces 1401 programs, was described in the NELIAC language and generated with the 7090 NELIAC system. The reduction in programming time and the improvement in documentation of the system were very significant.",

        "abstract":"A physically motivated approach is presented for computing a shape average of a given number of shapes. An elastic deformation is assigned to each shape. The shape average is then described as the common image under all elastic deformations of the given shapes, which minimizes the total elastic energy stored in these deformations. The underlying nonlinear elastic energy measures the local change of length, area, and volume. It is invariant under rigid body motions, and isometries are local minimizers. The model is relaxed involving a further energy which measures how well the elastic deformation image of a particular shape matches the average shape, and a suitable shape prior can be considered for the shape average. Shapes are represented via their edge sets, which also allows for an application to averaging image morphologies described via ensembles of edge sets. To make the approach computationally tractable, sharp edges are approximated via phase fields, and a corresponding variational phase field model is derived. Finite elements are applied for the spatial discretization, and a multiscale alternating minimization approach allows the efficient computation of shape averages in two and three dimensions. Various applications, e.g., averaging the shape of feet or human organs, underline the qualitative properties of the presented approach.",

Results indicate that 6-year-old emotional responses to orchestral extracts considered full of affective cues are similar to those demonstrated by adults and that there is no gender effect.",

On the basis of the analysis on the traditional 3D data compression method, this paper improves the traditional octree compression method, puts forward the fast dynamic coding method of dynamic octree, and provides improved compression coding algorithm and decoding algorithm, realizing the coding of orebody section model. Following the compressed storage of orebody section model, it can be known that the improved algorithm has prominent advantages in both compressing time and data storage space.",

        "abstract":"The reuse of libraries of classes by client applications is an interesting issue quite difficult to achieve, especially when modification of the class tree is needed but not possible because of the context. We propose a solution which is based on the presence of both specialisation and generalisation relationships in an object-oriented programming language. The specification of both relationships is based on a meta-model called OFL which provides a support for describing the operational semantics of a language through the definition of parameters and semantical actions. We propose an overview of the expressiveness of OFL and of its implementation and we give also some other interesting applications.",

        "abstract":"This article presents a pedestrian tracking methodology using an infrared sensor for surveillance applications. A distinctive feature of this study compared to the existing pedestrian tracking approaches is that the road network information is utilized for performance enhancement. A multiple model particle filter, which uses two different motion models, is designed for enabling the tracking of both road-constrained (on-road) and unconstrained (off-road) targets. The lateral position of the pedestrians on the walkways are taken into account by a specific on-road target model. The overall framework seamlessly integrates the negative information of occlusion events into the algorithm for which the required modifications are discussed. The resulting algorithm is illustrated on real data from a field trial for different scenarios.",

        "abstract":"A description is given of the FOIL (First-Order Inductive Learner) system, which exploits information from large numbers of examples to guide the search for a program. FOIL develops first-order rules from structured data described by a collection of relations. The guidance it provides turns out to be so effective that greedy search is usually adequate. Algorithms using greedy search, however, tend to suffer from a horizon effect: an action that might be desirable or even essential from a global perspective can appear relatively unpromising at a local level and so may be passed over. Rather than restricting the search space, and thus the class of learnable programs, FOIL exploits determinism to overcome some of the horizon effect of greedy search. The effect on learning time is usually negligible.",

The corresponding properties of the associated restricted composed maps from any of the subsets to itself are also dealt with in a formal context. The above subsets of the uniform metric space are not assumed to necessarily intersect but the case when they intersect leads to particular results of the general case in the sense that best proximity points become fixed points. Common fixed points and best proximity points of pairs of self-maps on the above subsets of the uniform metric space are also investigated.",

        "abstract":"Capacity bounds for a three-node binary symmetric relay channel with orthogonal components at the destination are studied. The cut-set upper bound and the rates achievable using decode-and-forward (DF), partial DF and compress-and-forward (CF) relaying are first evaluated. Then relaying strategies with finite memory-length are considered. An efficient algorithm for optimizing the relay functions is presented. The Boolean Fourier transform is then employed to unveil the structure of the optimized mappings. Interestingly, the optimized relay functions exhibit a simple structure. Numerical results illustrate that the rates achieved using the optimized low-dimensional functions are either comparable to those achieved by CF or superior to those achieved by DF relaying. In particular, the optimized low-dimensional relaying scheme can improve on DF relaying when the quality of the source-relay link is worse than or comparable to that of other links.",

        "abstract":"A global increase in PDA and cell phone ownership and a rise in the use of wireless services lead mobile browsing to become an important means of Internet access. However, mobile devices have a small screen, which limits the usability of mobile browsing. This paper presents a novel method that automatically adapts a desktop presentation to a mobile presentation, proceeding in two steps: detecting boundaries among different information blocks (i.e., page segmentation) and then generating a user preferred adaptive layout. Distinct from other approaches, our approach analyzes both the DOM structure and the visual layout to detect closely related contents. In the process of page segmentation, our approach first divides a Web page into several common areas (such as top, bottom, and main content), and then further identifies different topics in the main content based on the visual and structural analysis. The page segmentation produces a block tree, which represents the information organization underlying a Web page. Based on the block tree, an adaptive layout, which places closely related information in proximity and minimizes scrolling, is automatically generated. All current approaches support only one fixed style (e.g., a narrow-page style) to render an adaptive layout for a diverse range of users, Websites, and devices. This ''one size fits all'' strategy could not offer universal usability. Our approach supports a user to flexibly specify the style of an adaptive layout according to his\/her personal preferences. The theoretical foundation of such a user-centric adaptive layout is a feature space, which specifies an adaptive layout from different aspects, such as the location and presentation of navigation options. A user can visually manipulate those features to create a personalized style in a graphical user interface, and then an adaptive layout consistent with the personalized style is automatically generated. The user study based on a prototype shows the usability and efficiency of mobile browsing are significantly improved.",

        "abstract":"Recent research provided several new and fast approaches for the class of parameter estimation problems that are common in computer vision. Incorporation of complex noise model (mostly in form of covariance matrices) into errors-in-variables or total least squares models led to a considerable improvement of existing algorithms. However, most algorithms can only account for covariance of the same measurement - but many computer vision problems, e.g. gradient-based optical flow estimation, show correlations between different measurements. In this paper, we will present a new method for improving TLS based estimation with suitably chosen weights and it will be shown how to compute them for general noise models. The new method is applicable to a wide class of problems which share the same mathematical core. For demonstration purposes, we have chosen ellipse fitting as a experimental example.",

        "abstract":"How do group discussions affect the output of a usability inspection, as compared to individual evaluators only? This question was investigated in association with usability inspections of a music community website. Potential users of the website participated as evaluators in two usability inspection sessions. All evaluators made individual predictions prior to group discussions. Twenty-five percent of the usability issues generated in the group discussion were new, viz. not predicted by individual evaluators. Also, the group discussion served to discard or modify the majority of usability issues predicted by the individual evaluators. The discarded individual predictions were typically low severity.",

        "abstract":"This paper addresses how to perform cost-sensitive responses to routing attacks on Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET). There have been numerous research efforts on securing MANET protocols using cryptography or intrusion detection techniques. However, few writings have addressed MANET intrusion response. Most research on automated response for wired networks focuses on how to select the best response action to improve the security posture and availability of the system in a cost effective manner. We borrow this cost sensitive concept and develop a cost model for MANET. Two indices, Topology Dependency Index (TDI) and Attack Damage Index (ADI), are developed to reflect the response cost and attack damage, respectively. TDI measures the positional relationship between nodes and the attacker and ADI represents the routing damage caused by the attacker. Response cost, routing damage brought by the isolation response, can be calculated from TDI. Comparing TDI with ADI helps the response agents (\"RA\") to perform Adaptive Isolation while maintaining good network throughput. The simulation results show that launching adaptive isolations according to the comparison of TDI and ADI gives better network throughput than direct isolation. Therefore, the main contribution of our solution is to keep network connectivity when launching isolation responses and to do so such that good quality of network routing services is maintained.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents an in-depth study of the theory and algorithms for the SPFD-based (Set of Pairs of Functions to be Distinguished) rewiring, and explores the flexibility in the SPFD computation. Our contributions are in the following two areas: (1) We present a theorem and a related algorithm for more precise characterization of feasible SPFD-based rewiring. Extensive experimental results show that for LUT-based FPGAs, the rewiring ability of our new algorithm is 70% higher than SPFD-based local rewiring algorithms (SPFD-LR) [19][21] and 18% higher than the recently developed SPFD-based global rewiring algorithm (SPFD-GR)[20]. (2) In order to achieve more rewiring ability on certain selected wires used in various optimizations, we study the impact of using different atomic SPFD pair assignment methods during the SPFD-based rewiring. We develop several heuristic atomic SPFD pair assignment methods for area or delay minimization and show that they lead to 10% more selected rewiring ability than the random (or arbitrary) assignment methods. When combining (1) and (2) together, we can achieve 38.1% higher general rewiring ability.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents a data traffic model capable of describing the long-range as well as short-range dependence structure of packet data traffic. Specifically, we use the fractionally integrated autoregressive-moving average (FARIMA) process with non-Gaussian white driving sequence to describe packet arrival rate in a unit time. We introduce a procedure to estimate the fractional differencing parameter and ARMA coefficients: this procedure uses a cepstrum approach and does not require any prior knowledge about the driving noise distribution and the type of ARMA system. Since the main purpose of workload modeling is to aid in network performance evaluations, we are particularly interested in using the FARIMA model to predict bandwidth requirements for network traffic. We propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation strategy by employing linear predictors designed based on the estimated FARIMA parameters.",

        "abstract":"It is well known that simulation equivalence is an appropriate abstraction to be used in model checking because it strongly preserves ACTL* and provides a better space reduction than bisimulation equivalence. However, computing simulation equivalence is harder than computing bisimulation equivalence. A number of algorithms for computing simulation equivalence exist. Let \\Sigma denote the state space, \\to the transition relation and P_sim the partition of \\Sigma induced by simulation equivalence. The algorithms by Henzinger, Henzinger, Kopke and by Bloom and Paige run in O(|\\Sigma| |\\to|)-time and, as far as time-complexity is concerned, they are the best available algorithms. However, these algorithms have the drawback of a quadratic space complexity that is bounded from below by \\Omega(|\\Sigma|^2). The algorithm by Gentilini, Piazza, Policriti appears to be the best algorithm when both time and space complexities are taken into account. Gentilini et al.'s algorithm runs in O(|Psim|^2|\\to|)-time while the space complexity is in O(|P_sim|^2 + |\\Sigma| log(|P_sim|)). We present here a new efficient simulation equivalence algorithm that is obtained as a modification of Henzinger et al.'s algorithm and whose correctness is based on some techniques used in recent applications of abstract interpretation to model checking. Our algorithm runs in O(|P_sim| |\\to|)-time and O(|P_sim| |\\Sigma|)-space. Thus, while retaining a space complexity which is lower than quadratic, our algorithm improves the best known time bound.",

        "abstract":".\u00a0\u00a0 This paper presents a GIS-based decision support system prototype intended for use by public housing authority (PHA) administrators\n and planners designing policy for housing mobility programs. Housing mobility programs enable low-income families, many of\n whom live in government-operated public housing, to move to more desirable private-market rentals via rent subsidies. Unfortunately,\n housing authority planners have limited ability to visualize alternative relocation schemes of cohorts of low-income families\n or the impacts associated with these relocation policies. Thus, they are often not able to give highest-quality advice to\n clients regarding places to search for private-market rental housing. Housing Location Planner assists PHA planners in three\n ways: it analyzes spatial, demographic and housing market characteristics of the study area, selects certain portions of the\n study area for input to an optimization model which generates alternative family allocations, and displays optimization model\n results in a way that links decision variable values and objective function values. Housing Location Planner is seen as a\n first step in the development of even more sophisticated multi-stakeholder spatial decision support systems for subsidized\n housing planning in which one or more alternative allocations of families across a study area is chosen as a basis for policy\n initiatives.",

To extract word images from image regions, the character components need to be separated from graphic components. For this process, we propose a method to separate them with an analysis of box-plot using a statistics of structural components. An accuracy of this method is not sensitive to the changes of images because the criterion of separation is defined by the statistics of components. And then the character regions are determined by analyzing a local crowdedness of the separated character elements. Finally, we divide the character regions into text lines and word images using projection profile analysis and gap clustering, etc. The proposed system could reduce the influence resulted from the changes of images because it uses the criterion based on the statistics of image regions.",

        "abstract":"The objective of the paper is to present the concept of using selected computational intelligence methods in conjunction with discrete event simulation (DES) models of chosen logistics processes. A review of the recent literature in the scope of applications of discrete event simulation methods indicates that researchers who use these methods more and more often employ techniques from the area of computational intelligence, especially in cases when the phenomena, processes or systems modeled feature complexity, uncertainty or non-linearity. The issues discussed in the paper refer to modeling selected logistics processes at the company that produces electricity and thermal energy.",

A decen- tralized computational market model (DCMM) is proposed in this paper. In this model, the supply & demand of computational resources is balanced by the market mechanism without central control. Comparing with computa- tional market models and methods previously developed, the no-center archi- tecture is an innovation and fits well with the grid environment.",

        "abstract":"In this paper we present an approach to efficiently trace single rays on the Cell Processor, instead of using ray packets. To benefit from the performance of this processor, a data structure is chosen which allows traversal without excessive accesses to main memory. Together with careful optimization for SIMD processing, a performance comparable to a packet based ray tracer, running on the same hardware, is achieved. In special cases, when the coherency of the traced rays get very low, it even outperforms the packet based approach.",

        "abstract":"The Interpolation-Based Bintree (IBB) is a new encoding scheme for representing binary images. This encoding scheme combines the features of linear quadtrees, binary trees, and interpolation-based codes. The implementation of the IBB is shown to be very simple and storage-saving. Based on the IBB structure, this paper presents some fast sequential algorithms for set operations (intersection, union, and complement), 4-neighbors finding, and diagonal neighbors finding, respectively. Given two sets of bincodes, B 1 , and B 2 , with respect to two images, the set operations can be performed in O ( n + m ) time, where n is the size of B 1 and m is the size of B 2 ; the complement operation for B 1 ( B 2 ) can be performed in O ( n )( O ( m )) time; and the 4-neighbors finding and the diagonal neighbors finding for B 1 ( B 2 ) can be accomplished in O ( n log n )( O ( m log m )) time.",

        "abstract":"  Email Retrieval task has recently taken much attention to help the user retrieve the email(s) related to the submitted query. Up to our knowledge, existing email retrieval ranking approaches sort the retrieved emails based on some heuristic rules, which are either search clues or some predefined user criteria rooted in email fields. Unfortunately, the user usually does not know the effective rule that acquires best ranking related to his query. This paper presents a new email retrieval ranking approach to tackle this problem. It ranks the retrieved emails based on a scoring function that depends on crucial email fields, namely subject, content, and sender. The paper also proposes an architecture to allow every user in a network\/group of users to be able, if permissible, to know the most important network senders who are interested in his submitted query words. The experimental evaluation on Enron corpus prove that our approach outperforms known email retrieval ranking approaches ",

Our aim is to identify model mechanisms that allow one to explain the trends observed in clinical measurements of the number of CD4+ T-cells and virus throughout the long-term HIV-1 infection, from the acute phase until the onset of AIDS. To achieve our goal, we apply some standard methods of modeling and analysis of dynamical systems. Among these methods, are model development and validation processes such as parameter estimation, as well as Painleve and bifurcation analysis.",

        "abstract":"There is a significant body of empirical work on statistical de-anonymization attacks against databases containing micro-data about individuals, e.g., their preferences, movie ratings, or transaction data. Our goal is to analytically explain why such attacks work. Specifically, we analyze a variant of the Narayanan-Shmatikov algorithm that was used to effectively de-anonymize the Netflix database of movie ratings. We prove theorems characterizing mathematical properties of the database and the auxiliary information available to the adversary that enable two classes of privacy attacks. In the first attack, the adversary successfully identifies the individual about whom she possesses auxiliary information (an isolation attack). In the second attack, the adversary learns additional information about the individual, although she may not be able to uniquely identify him (an information amplification attack). We demonstrate the applicability of the analytical results by empirically verifying that the mathematical properties assumed of the database are actually true for a significant fraction of the records in the Netflix movie ratings database, which contains ratings from about 500,000 users.",

        "abstract":"Automated software testing is an important and time-saving activity used by software testing teams, working on rapid and large scale software projects. TestComplete is an example of a currently widely used testing tool. However, its test recorder tool shows some weaknesses when using GUI (Graphical User Interface) test recording, for dynamic web applications. After recording a GUI test using TestComplete recorder, TestComplete fails to run again later on, because some of the onscreen objects cannot be recognized by it. However, since the TestComplete recorder tool generates tests in scripting languages, the tests can themselves be refined and modified to be robust and much more accurate. This paper presents an algorithm for writing robust and successful test scripts for TestComplete against dynamic web applications. It also presents a comparative study with the Web Performance Test tool provided by Microsoft Visual Studio.",

        "abstract":"For a complex multiclass problem, it is common to construct the multiclass classifier by combining the outputs of several binary ones. The two basic methods for this purpose are known as one-per-class (OPC) and pairwise coupling (PWC) and their general form is error correcting output code (ECOC). In this paper, we review basic decomposition methods and introduce a new sequential fusion method based on OPC and PWC according to their properties. In the experiments, we compare our proposed method with each basic method and ECOC method. The experimental results show that our proposed method can improve significantly the classification accuracy on the real dataset.",

        "abstract":"Semantic lexical matching is a prominent subtask within text understanding applications. Yet, it is rarely evaluated in a direct manner. This paper proposes a definition for lexical reference which captures the common goals of lexical matching. Based on this definition we created and analyzed a test dataset that was utilized to directly evaluate, compare and improve lexical matching models. We suggest that such decomposition of the global semantic matching task is critical in order to fully understand and improve individual components.",

        "abstract":"Actor agents in a virtual reality and interactive drama must deliver a believable performance. This is challenging and many issues need to be resolved. One prominent problem is that the goals of a character in an emergent interactive drama may conflict with demands for coherency in the drama's progress. We propose an approach to resolve this that uses Object Oriented Bayesian networks and intelligent agents with dual roles: an actor role focused on the dramatic goals of the story, and a character role focused on believable actions in line with the character's personality and goals.",

        "abstract":"\n In ad hoc networks, relay nodes use their limited resources such as battery capacity, CPU, buffer, etc. to support other nodes\u2019\n communications. This discourages users from joining an ad hoc network and becoming a relay node. Receiving a reward for supporting\n relay may encourage users to join such networks. This research focuses on the factors of residual battery power, and time\n during which AC power supply is not available. In this paper, the willingness to receive reward for relay in ad hoc networks\n is investigated by questionnaire survey. The relation between such factors and the willingness to receive rewards for relay\n is analysed quantitatively and models of willingness to receive reward for relay are estimated.\n \n ",

Because in practice the embedded data just lie into a subspace of the kernel-induced space, F, we can search a set of basis vectors (BVs) to express all the SVs according to the geometrical structure, the number of which is less than that of SVs. The experimental results show that our method can reduce the run-time complexity in SVM with the preservation of machine's generalization, especially for the data of large correlation coefficients among input samples.",

In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate whether a pattern is informative. From that, important patterns can be extracted automatically. Patterns must be extracted from high quality and huge set of game records. In experiment, we implement the method in such set of Othello game records.",

        "abstract":"Vehicle trajectories are widely used in varies of applications. As to car navigation applications, typical usages of trajectories include correcting the digital maps, finding out the traffic jams, looking for the locations of cars. In this paper, it is assumed that trajectory data of expert drivers implies \u201cbest practice\u201d routes, which will be helpful to na\u00efve drivers during driving. Therefore we propose a new idea called \u201ccollaborative navigation\u201d in which the best practice routes are mined from trajectories and are send to na\u00efve drivers when needed. The major difficulties of this approach are that the trajectory data may be too large and the data processing time may be too long. To address the problem, we design a framework which covers the whole life cycle of trajectories processing, including original data collection, \u201cpoint to route\u201d conversion, \u201cbest route\u201d mining, and route query. Corresponding algorithms, data structures and data indexes are devised for each step in the life cycle. Experiments show \u201ccollaborative navigation\u201d can be used to enhance routing selection with small footprint and quick response time using our framework.",

        "abstract":"Formal Engineering Education has traditionally been delivered using the low technology-high touch lecturing method, in which the lecturer and student meet face to face. Distance education in this field has been quite slow to develop primarily because of difficulty in delivery of practical based instructions and problems on integrity of assessments. Developments in information technology and the increased demand for further education by people already in employment have however changed this even in developing countries. It puts extra demand on Lecturers to guide distance learners in handling numerical computations so prevalent in Engineering. At the campuses, computer based methods are available in the high touch-high tech lecture method. High level and efficient computer software is used to help the student to simulate and solve some problems. However, such software is expensive-and therefore-not readily available to the distant learner. Spreadsheets on the other hand are almost universal on today's computers and they bridge the gap between hand calculations and high level programme computations. This paper therefore makes a case for the use of spreadsheets in Distance Engineering Education. An example in Spring Design, Selection and Adaptation is used to illustrate the simplification and other advantages of their use by practicing distance learners. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "abstract":"This demo presents a decision tree based classification system for uncertain data. Decision tree is a commonly used data classification technique. Tree learning algorithms can generate decision tree models from a training data set. When working on uncertain data or probabilistic data, the learning and prediction algorithms need handle the uncertainty cautiously, or else the decision tree could be unreliable and prediction results may be wrong. In this demo, we will present DTU, a new decision tree based classification and prediction system for uncertain data. This tool uses new measures for constructing, pruning and optimizing decision tree. These new measures are computed considering uncertain data probability distribution functions. Based on the new measures, the optimal splitting attributes and splitting values can be identified and used in the decision tree. We will show in this demo that DTU can process various types of uncertainties and it has satisfactory classification performance even when data is highly uncertain.",

        "abstract":"Multipath routing is employed extensively in wireless mesh networks for fault tolerance, throughput enhancement, and load balancing purposes. Most existing multipath routing methods tend to establish link-disjoint or node-disjoint paths with minimal path costs. As paths created by these methods are typically close to each other, they may cause serious inter-path interference when serving for concurrent data transmissions. In this paper, we first introduce an AODV-based decoupled multipath routing protocol named AODV-DM. AODV-DM builds an insulating region around each established path to prevent new paths from being formed in the neighborhood of the established path. Multiple paths formed by this means are ''isolated'' from each other; thereby they are very suitable to serve for concurrent data transmissions. We also investigate the transport-layer route-coupling problem, and conclude that a path-aware SCTP scheme is a very good match to our AODV-DM protocol. The path-aware SCTP scheme enables the transport layer to make the most of the capacity provided by decoupled multipath. We simulate the AODV-DM protocol and integrate it with the path-aware SCTP protocol. The simulation results demonstrate that AODV-DM, combined with the path-aware SCTP, significantly boosts end-to-end throughput of multihop data transmissions. This decoupled multipath structure is especially beneficial to concurrent transmissions of time-constraint data in wireless mesh networks.",

        "abstract":"Due to the random nature of photon emission and the various internal noise sources of the detectors, real timelapse fluores- cence microscopy images are usually modeled as the sum of a Poisson process plus some Gaussian white noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of our SURE-LET denoising strategy to take advantage of the potentially strong similari- ties between adjacent frames of the observed image sequence. To stabilize the noise variance, we first apply the generalized Anscombe transform using suitable parameters automatically estimated from the observed data. With the proposed algo- rithm, we show that, in a reasonable computation time, real fluorescence timelapse microscopy images can be denoised with higher quality than conventional algorithms.",

        "abstract":"We present a unique decoding algorithm of algebraic geometry (AG) codes on plane curves, Hermitian codes in particular, from an interpolation point of view. The algorithm successfully corrects errors of weight up to half of the order bound on the minimum distance of the AG code. It is the first decoding algorithm to combine some features of the interpolation-based list decoding with the performance of the syndrome decoding with the majority voting scheme. The regular structure of the algorithm allows a straightforward parallel implementation.",

        "abstract":"This paper proposes a new fuzzy regression model, i.e., the fuzzy system constructed by rule generation and iterative linear support vector regression (FS-RGLSVR) for structural risk minimization. The FS-RGLSVR is composed of Takagi\u2013Sugeno (TS)-type fuzzy if\u2013then rules. These rules are automatically constructed by a self-splitting rule generation algorithm that introduces the self-splitting technique to the $k$-means clustering algorithm. This new algorithm regards a cluster as a fuzzy rule, where no preassignment of the cluster (rule) number is necessary. The cost function for parameter learning is defined based on structural risk instead of empirical risk minimization in order to achieve generalizability. Tuning all of the free parameters in the FS-RGLSVR using linear support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to minimize the cost function. Each of the consequent and antecedent part parameters is expressed as a linear combination coefficient in a transformed input space so that the linear SVR is applicable. This paper introduces iterative linear SVR to tune antecedent and consequent parameters. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of FS-RGLSVR by two simulated and four practical regression examples. Comparisons with fuzzy systems with different types of learning algorithms verify the performance of the FS-RGLSVR.",

Inorder to  provide  the  freedom  of  movement  to  users,  we  developed an  architecture  that  allows  projected  applications  to  roam a  network  of  projection  units  to  follow  the  users.  The  concept of  connecting  physical  objects  with  content  in  form  of  projected applications,  although  devised  for  projection  based  augmented reality systems, can be applied to HMD based or hand held AR systems as well. After a description of our AR projection system and  a  example  application  that  could  be  used  to  provide  location specific  information  to  travelers  using  public  transportation systems, we will lay out our vision of a system that may be able to provide content on a global scale.  . Inorder,to  overcome ,these  limitations  we  use ,several  networked,AR-projection units. We developed an architecture consisting of  an ,application  server  and ,any ,number ,of  projection units that allows our projected applications to roam these units.

        "abstract":"This article evaluates the Durkheim\/Berger argument that integration in a network of co-religionists protects against anomia. The 1985 General Social Survey network instrument is used to evaluate the effect of integration on anomia and the probability of unhappiness. Results indicate that contact with religiously homogeneous others paired with personal religious belief reduces anomia and the likelihood of unhappiness. Additionally, while ego\/alter closeness is important, alter\/alter closeness is not. These results suggest that individuals benefit from religious association more so than religious community. Additional analyses indicate that these results are unlikely to be due to homophily.",

        "abstract":"We consider markets in the classical Arrow-Debreumodel. There are n agents and m goods. Each buyer hasa concave utility function (of the bundle of goods he\/shebuys) and an initial bundle. At an \u201cequilibrium\u201d set ofprices for goods, if each individual buyer separately ex-changes the initial bundle for an optimal bundle at the setprices, the market clears, i.e., all goods are exactly con-sumed. Classical theorems guarantee the existence of equi-libria, but computing them has been the subject of muchrecent research. In the related area of Multi-Agent Games,much attention has been paid to the complexity as well asalgorithms. While most general problems are hard, poly-nomial time algorithms have been developed for restrictedclasses of games, when one assumes the number of strate-gies is constant.For the Market Equilibrium problem, several importantspecial cases of utility functions have been tackled. Here webegin a program for this problem similar to that for multi-agent games, where general utilities are considered. We be-gin by showing that if the utilities are separable piece-wiselinear concave (PLC) functions, and the number of goods(or alternatively the number of buyers) is constant, thenwe can compute an exact equilibrium in polynomial time.Our technique for the constant number of goods is to de-compose the space of price vectors into cells using certainhyperplanes, so that in each cell, each buyer\u2019s thresholdmarginal utility is known. Still, one needs to solve a linear optimization problem in each cell. We then show the mainresult - that for general (non-separable) PLC utilities, anexact equilibrium can be found in polynomial time providedthe number of goods is constant. The starting point of thealgorithm is a \u201ccell-decomposition\u201d of the space of pricevectors using polynomial surfaces (instead of hyperplanes).We use results from computational algebraic geometry tobound the number of such cells. For solving the probleminside each cell, we introduce and use a novel LP-dualitybased method. We note that if the number of buyers andagents both can vary, the problem is PPAD hard even forthe very special case of PLC utilities - namely Leontief utilities.",

This exploratory study investigates the value users derive from self-described 'cool' Facebook applications, and explores the features that either encourage or discourage users to recommend applications to their friends. The concepts of value and cool are explored in a social networking context. Our qualitative data reveals consumers derive a combination of functional value along with either social or emotional value from the applications. Female Facebook users indicate self-expression as important motivators, while males tend to use Facebook applications to socially compete. Three broad categories emerged for application features; symmetrical features can both encourage or discourage recommendation, polar features where different levels of the same feature encourage or discourage, and uni-directional features only encourage or discourage but not both. Recommending or not recommending an application tends to be the result of a combination of features and context, rather than one feature in isolation.",

        "abstract":"A new combinatorial approach to 3D molecular design is presented. Proceeding from atom-atom connectivity augmented by the type of atoms and multiplicity of chemical bonds, it provides an exhaustive generation of all stereoisomers, enantiomers, and conformers, corresponding to the given molecular topochemistry. The core of the system is the so called idea of \"propagating 3D spanning tree\". The latter is an acyclic 3D model of the molecular skeleton. During propagation, it loses its acyclic character by closure of rings and eventually transforms into a 3D molecular skeleton. A current bond of 3D-spanning tree is positioned in the space by using a recursive procedure based on the 3D information of its already constructed predecessors. Bond lengths and valence angles are adjusted in advance by using MMPI parametrization. All possible rotamers at allowed torsional angle resolutions are explored, retaining those which pass the tests for geometric constraints, including nonbonded cutoff, ring-closure parameters, and torsional resolution. The number of generated isomers can be controlled by managing the values of these geometric constraints. The system provides a hierarchical set of rules for screening the generated 3D models according to the chemical expertise. In case of strained cyclic structures, some of the conformers obtained could be distorted with respect to the reference values of bond lengths and torsional and valence angles. Here, an original strain minimization technique could be applied based on a simple energy-like function, where the electrostatic terms are omitted. 3DGEN algorithm is incorporated in the 3DMOL module of the OASIS system for computer assisted structure-property studies. It can be applied also for investigation of the molecular similarity on a 3D level.",

        "abstract":"This paper proposes to investigate learning and forgetting effects on the problem of scheduling families of jobs on a single machine to minimize total completion time of jobs. A setup time is incurred whenever the single machine transfers job processing from a family to another family. To analyze the impact of learning and forgetting on this group scheduling problem, we structure three basic models and make some comparisons through computational experiments. The three models, including no forgetting, total forgetting and partial forgetting, assume that the processing time of a job is dependent on its position in a schedule. Some scheduling rules and a lower bound are derived in order to constitute our branch-and-bound algorithm for searching an optimal sequence. In addition, an efficient and simply-structured heuristic is also built to find a near-optimal schedule.",

There is an increasing belief that the difficulties of image management and description should be led and defined by the needs of users and by their information seeking behaviours. The Focusing Images for Learning and Teaching - an Enriched Resource (FILTER) project is investigating, through an online image description exercise, the ways that users describe different types of images. Through analysis of the exercise results, FILTER hopes to obtain an understanding of the ways in which people describe images and the factors that influence their approaches to image description and thus appropriate metadata. Preliminary analysis of data indicates that there is little consensus on the use of terms for image description or on categorisation of images into 'types'.",

        "abstract":"MANET refers to a network designed for special applications for which it is difficult to use a backbone network. In MANET, a lot of network troubles occur due to the mobility of nodes and the limitation of energy. Therefore, when performing ubiquitous services with the application of MANET, a technique is required to improve the packet transmission rate so as to enable continuous packet transmission while flexibly adapting to topology changes caused by the mobility of nodes. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a mixed protocol that applies both PAOMDV (Possibility based AOMDV) and OLSR-ME (OLSR with Modify Energy Efficiency). In this protocol, PAOMDV takes charge of the outside of cluster and OLSR-ME the inside of cluster so that the two protocols can complement each other. By experiment, this study compares the proposed protocol with the conventional protocols of AODV, AOMDV, and ZRP, and verifies its performance.",

The latest trend in Web applications encourages highly interactive Web sites with rich user interfaces featuring content integrated from various sources around the Web. The obvious potential of RDF, SPARQL, and OWL to provide flexible data modeling, easier data integration, and networked data access may be the answer to the classic problems. Using Semantic Web technologies we have created a Web application, the ConceptWiki, as an end-to-end solution for creating browserbased readwrite triples using RDF, which focus on data integration and ease of use for the end user. Here we will demonstrate the integration of a biological data source, the ENZYME database, into the ConceptWiki and it's representation in RDF. ",

To obtain high resolution brightness temperature, downscaling brightness temperature uses higher resolution visible\/infrared satellite data and is based on the method of retrieving land surface temperature with passive microwave and the relationship between Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI) and NDVL High resolution soil moisture is retrieved with downscaled brightness temperature using a single-channel algorithm (SCA), and the Qp model used to deal with the influence of roughness. Downscaled brightness temperature is compared with the aircraft data during the Experiment in the Heihe River Basin in China. The retrieved high resolution soil moisture is compared with in situ (0-6 cm depth) point measurements during SMEX02, obtaining R2 = 0.74 and RMSE as 0.047 cm3 cm-3.",

        "abstract":"Uncertain data are usually represented in terms of an uncertainty region over which a probability density function (pdf) is defined. In the context of uncertain data management, there has been a growing interest in clustering uncertain data. In particular, the classic K-means clustering algorithm has been recently adapted to handle uncertain data. However, the centroid-based partitional clustering approach used in the adapted K-means presents two major weaknesses that are related to: (i)an accuracy issue, since cluster centroids are computed as deterministic objects using the expected values of the pdfs of the clustered objects; and, (ii)an efficiency issue, since the expected distance between uncertain objects and cluster centroids is computationally expensive.In this paper, we address the problem of clustering uncertain data by proposing a K-medoids-based algorithm, called UK-medoids, which is designed to overcome the above issues. In particular, our UK-medoids algorithm employs distance functions properly defined for uncertain objects, and exploits a K-medoids scheme. Experiments have shown that UK-medoids outperforms existing algorithms from an accuracy viewpoint while achieving reasonably good efficiency.",

        "abstract":"We compute the singular points of a plane rational curve, parametrically given, using the implicitization matrix derived from the @m-basis of the curve. It is shown that singularity factors, which are defined and uniquely determined by the elementary divisors of the implicitization matrix, contain all the information about the singular points, such as the parameter values of the singular points and their multiplicities. Based on this observation, an efficient and numerically stable algorithm for computing the singular points is devised, and inversion formulae for the singular points are derived. In particular, high order singular points can be detected and computed effectively. This approach based on singularity factors can also determine whether a rational curve has any non-ordinary singular points that contain singular points in its infinitely near neighborhood. Furthermore, a method is proposed to determine whether a singular point is ordinary or not. Finally, a conjecture in [Chionh, E.-W., Sederberg, T.W., 2001. On the minors of the implicitization bezout matrix for a rational plane curve. Computer Aided Geometric Design 18, 21-36] regarding the multiplicity of the singular points of a plane rational curve is proved.",

        "abstract":"Xoring two permutations is a very simple way to construct pseudorandom functions from pseudorandom permutations. The aim of this paper is to get precise security results for this construction. Since such construction has many applications in cryptography (see [2,3,4,6] for example), this problem is interesting both from a theoretical and from a practical point of view. In [6], it was proved that Xoring two random permutations gives a secure pseudorandom function if $m \\ll 2^{\\frac {2n}{3}}$. By \"secure\" we mean here that the scheme will resist all adaptive chosen plaintext attacks limited to mqueries (even with unlimited computing power). More generally in [6] it is also proved that with kXor, instead of 2, we have security when $m \\ll 2^{\\frac {kn}{k+1}}$. In this paper we will prove that for k= 2, we have in fact already security when m\u8302\u622e\u9a74 O(2n). Therefore we will obtain a proof of a similar result claimed in [2] (security when m\u8302\u622e\u9a74 O(2n\/n2\/3)). Moreover our proof is very different from the proof strategy suggested in [2] (we do not use Azuma inequality and Chernoff bounds for example), and we will get precise and explicit Ofunctions. Another interesting point of our proof is that we will show that this (cryptographic) problem of security is directly related to a very simple to describe and purely combinatorial problem. An extended version of this paper can be obtained on eprint [8].",

        "abstract":"When a three dimensional object is known to be lying on a planar surface, its pose is restricted from six to three degrees of freedom. Computer vision algorithms can exploit the few stable poses of modeled objects to simplify scene interpretation and more accurately determine object location. This paper presents necessary and sufficient conditions for the pose of a piecewise smooth curved three-dimensional object to be stable. For objects whose surfaces are represented by implicit algebraic equations, these conditions can be expressed as systems of polynomial equations that are readily solved by homotopy continuation. Examples from the implemented algorithm are presented.",

        "abstract":"New architectural solutions for parallel systems built of bus-based shared memory processor clusters are presented A new paradigm is proposed for inter-processor communication, called communication on the fly. With this paradigm, processors can be dynamically switched between clusters at program run-time to bring in their caches data that can be read by many processors in a cluster at the same time they are written to the cluster memory. A cache controlled macro data flow program execution paradigm is also proposed. Programs are structured into tasks for which all required data are brought to the processor data cache before task execution. A new graph representation of programs is introduced, which enables modeling of functioning of data caches, memories, bus arbiters, processor switching between clusters and parallel reads of data on the fly. This representation is used for realistic simulation of a numerical algorithm execution based on distribution of parallel tasks between dynamic SMP clusters and on communication on the fly. Performance evaluation results are presented for different configurations of the programs and shared memory clusters in the system.",

        "abstract":"Intention recognition is ubiquitous in most social interactions among humans and other primates. Despite this, the role of intention recognition in the emergence of cooperative actions remains elusive. Resorting to the tools of evolutionary game theory, herein we describe a computational model showing how intention recognition coevolves with cooperation in populations of self-regarding individuals. By equipping some individuals with the capacity of assessing the intentions of others in the course of a prototypical dilemma of cooperation-the repeated prisoner's dilemma-we show how intention recognition is favored by natural selection, opening a window of opportunity for cooperation to thrive. We introduce a new strategy IR that is able to assign an intention to the actions of opponents, on the basis of an acquired corpus consisting of possible plans achieving that intention, as well as to then make decisions on the basis of such recognized intentions. The success of IR is grounded on the free exploitation of unconditional cooperators while remaining robust against unconditional defectors. In addition, we show how intention recognizers do indeed prevail against the best-known successful strategies of iterated dilemmas of cooperation, even in the presence of errors and reduction of fitness associated with a small cognitive cost for performing intention recognition.",

        "abstract":"IP routers are now increasingly expected to do more than just traditional packet forwarding - they must be extensible as well as scalable. It is a challenge to design a router architecture to support both high (and increasing) packet forwarding rates as well as a wide array of packet processing services. The most easily extensible design would be entirely software-based, but this is in tension with the requirement for high performance. One possible answer is to couple a software-based router with a high performance platform. Cluster-based supercomputers are very successful due to their scalability and high availability, and they also exhibit outstanding performance\/cost ratio. In this paper, we describe the implementation and evaluation of an extensible and scalable software-based IP router, which is built using a cluster of processors connected by a high-speed\/low latency InfiniBand interconnection network. Our measurements show that the performance of this router can be scaled nearly linearly with increasing hardware",

        "abstract":"When accidents or disasters happen, emergency response time is always crucial. Most procedures in the existing emergency vehicle dispatching systems rely heavily on manual assignments. In this paper, we propose a novel emergency vehicle dispatching system to reduce emergency response time, which includes automatic emergency resource assignment and driving path planning to reduce unnecessary time delay caused by human misjudgment or the delay caused by traffic jam. As the traffic condition varies from time to time, the traffic information employed in the proposed method needs to trace back to several weeks prior to the dispatching time. Furthermore, we also propose a lane reservation scheme for emergency vehicles to minimize the crash risks. Before an emergency vehicle arrives at each road segment, Road Side Units start to disseminate the warning message at suitable time, so that other drivers could have enough time to take proper actions such as speed acceleration or switching lanes. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can largely reduce the traveling time of emergency vehicles comparing to the shortest path approach with sirens and lights to alert other drivers. With the traveling time as well as emergency resource assignment time being reduced, the emergency rescue teams would gain edges in rescuing lives and property.",

A survey of the currently available methods for solving this problem is given, and the most promising among them from the standpoint of processing large arrays of documents are selected. Then, the methods selected are refined and modified, and, on the basis of these methods, a system for storing XML documents in an RDBMS is constructed. Finally, the performance of this system for each method considered is tested, and, by the results of these tests, an optimal relational schema is selected.",

        "abstract":"The problem of computing the electrostatic energy of a large molecule is considered. It is reduced to solving the Poisson equation inside and the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the exterior, coupled by boundary conditions. A Monte Carlo estimate for the potential point values, their derivatives, and the energy is constructed. The estimate is based on the walk on spheres and Green's function first passage algorithms; the walk in subdomains technique; and finite-difference approximations of the boundary condition. Results of some illustrative calculations are presented.",

        "abstract":"A B S T R A C T The widespread use of wireless cellular networks has made security an ever increasing concern. GSM is the most popular wireless cellular standard, but security is an issue. The most critical weakness in the GSM protocol is the use of one-way entity authentication, i.e., only the mobile station is authenticated by the network. This creates many security problems including vulnerability against man-in-the-middle attacks. Several solutions have been proposed to establish mutual entity authentication. However, none provide a aw-free bilateral authentication protocol. In this paper, we show that a recently proposed solution is vulnerable to a \"type attack\". Then, we propose a novel mutual entity authentication using the TESLA protocol. The proposed solution not only provides secure bilateral authentication, but also decreases the call setup time and the required connection bandwidth. An important feature of the proposed protocol is that it is compatible with the GSM standard.",

While the literature has dealt with the case of no information flow across partnerships, we consider the case in which players can issue a \u201creference letter\u201d to verify at least that the partnership entered the cooperation phase. We show that such reference letters can be voluntarily provided by the partners even at some cost, and that the sheer existence of a letter shortens the trust-building periods and thus improves social efficiency.",

        "abstract":"While pure output-buffered ATM switches achieve the best possible throughput-delay performance, most of them suffer from high complexity. In this paper, we describe a low-complexity output buffering deflection-routing based ATM switch, called the Multi Single-Stage-Shuffling Switch (MS4). Our work is motivated by the observation that cells which lose contention in any of the Tandem-Banyan switch networks do not contribute to the throughput of the switch until they reach the inputs of the following network. The MS4 is based on multi-layering of unbuffered single-stage interconnection networks. It preserves cell-sequencing while providing cells with multiple concurrent paths for each input-output pair. The switch is analysed under uniform traffic assuming arbitrary switch parameters. It is shown that a complexity of only O(N log\"2N) is required to achieve arbitrary small cell loss probabilities in the interconnection network, for a switch of size N. Simulation is used to assess the accuracy of the analysis and to examine the MS4 under a variety of traffic models. The MS4 is shown to be robust under non-uniform traffic. It is also shown to compare well to other known ATM switch architectures. Finally, a variation of the switch is described, analysed and compared to the original design.",

        "abstract":"  Subthreshold circuit designs are very much popular for some of the ultra low power applications, where the minimum energy consumption is the primary concern. But, due to the weak driving current, these circuits generally suffer from huge performance degradation. Therefore, in this paper, we primarily targeted to analyze the performance of a Near-Threshold Circuit (NTC), which retains the excellent energy efficiency of the subthreshold design, while improving the performance to a certain extent. A modified row-based dual Vdd 4-operand CSA (Carry Save Adder) design has been reported in the present work using 45 nm technology. Moreover, to find out the effectiveness of the near-threshold operation of the 4-operand CSA design; it has been compared with the other design styles. From the simulation results, obtained for the frequency of 20 MHz, we found that the proposed scheme of CSA design consumes 3.009*10-7 Watt of Average Power (Pavg), which is almost 90.9 % lesser than that of the conventional CSA design. Whereas, looking at the perspective of maximum delay at output, the proposed scheme of CSA design provides a fair 44.37 % improvement, compared to that of the subthreshold CSA design. ",

        "abstract":"Uncertain or imprecise data are pervasive in applications like location-based services, sensor monitoring, and data collection and integration. For these applications, probabilistic databases can be used to store uncertain data, and querying facilities are provided to yield answers with statistical confidence. Given that a limited amount of resources is available to \"clean\" the database (e.g., by probing some sensor data values to get their latest values), we address the problem of choosing the set of uncertain objects to be cleaned, in order to achieve the best improvement in the quality of query answers. For this purpose, we present the PWS-quality metric, which is a universal measure that quantifies the ambiguity of query answers under the possible world semantics. We study how PWS-quality can be efficiently evaluated for two major query classes: (1) queries that examine the satisfiability of tuples independent of other tuples (e.g., range queries); and (2) queries that require the knowledge of the relative ranking of the tuples (e.g., MAX queries). We then propose a polynomial-time solution to achieve an optimal improvement in PWS-quality. Other fast heuristics are presented as well. Experiments, performed on both real and synthetic datasets, show that the PWS-quality metric can be evaluated quickly, and that our cleaning algorithm provides an optimal solution with high efficiency. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that develops a quality metric for a probabilistic database, and investigates how such a metric can be used for data cleaning purposes.",

        "abstract":"The topic of managing uncertain data has been explored in many ways. Different methodologies for data storage and query processing have been proposed. As the availability of management systems grows, the research on analytics of uncertain data is gaining in importance. Similar to the challenges faced in the field of data management, algorithms for uncertain data mining also have a high performance degradation compared to their certain algorithms. To overcome the problem of performance degradation, the MCDB approach was developed for uncertain data management based on the possible world scenario. As this methodology shows significant performance and scalability enhancement, we adopt this method for the field of mining on uncertain data. In this paper, we introduce a clustering methodology for uncertain data and illustrate current issues with this approach within the field of clustering uncertain data.",

        "abstract":"Recent advancements in genetics and proteomics have led to the acquisition of large quantitative data sets. However, the use of these data to reverse engineer biochemical networks has remained a challenging problem. Many methods have been proposed to infer biochemical network topologies from different types of biological data. Here, we focus on unraveling network topologies from steady state responses of biochemical networks to successive experimental perturbations.We propose a computational algorithm which combines a deterministic network inference method termed Modular Response Analysis (MRA) and a statistical model selection algorithm called Bayesian Variable Selection, to infer functional interactions in cellular signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks. It can be used to identify interactions among individual molecules involved in a biochemical pathway or reveal how different functional modules of a biological network interact with each other to exchange information. In cases where not all network components are known, our method reveals functional interactions which are not direct but correspond to the interaction routes through unknown elements. Using computer simulated perturbation responses of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks from the DREAM challenge, we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust against noise and scalable to large networks. We also show that our method can infer network topologies using incomplete perturbation datasets. Consequently, we have used this algorithm to explore the ERBB regulated G1\/S transition pathway in certain breast cancer cells to understand the molecular mechanisms which cause these cells to become drug resistant. The algorithm successfully inferred many well characterized interactions of this pathway by analyzing experimentally obtained perturbation data. Additionally, it identified some molecular interactions which promote drug resistance in breast cancer cells.The proposed algorithm provides a robust, scalable and cost effective solution for inferring network topologies from biological data. It can potentially be applied to explore novel pathways which play important roles in life threatening disease like cancer.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for constructing a volumetric T-spline from B-reps inspired by constructive solid geometry Boolean operations. By solving a harmonic field with proper boundary conditions, the input surface is automatically decomposed into regions that are classified into two groups represented, topologically, by either a cube or a torus. We perform two Boolean operations (union and difference) with the primitives and convert them into polycubes through parametric mapping. With these polycubes, octree subdivision is carried out to obtain a volumetric T-mesh, and sharp features detected from the input model are also preserved. An optimization is then performed to improve the quality of the volumetric T-spline. The obtained T-spline surface is C 2 everywhere except the local region surrounding irregular nodes, where the surface continuity is elevated from C 0 to G 1. Finally, we extract trivariate B\u00e9zier elements from the volumetric T-spline and use them directly in isogeometric analysis.",

        "abstract":"A typical task in a wireless sensor network is that every sensor node senses its local environment and, upon request, sends the data of interest back to a base station. Based on this many-to-one communication pattern, we first propose a dis- tributed N-to-1 multipath discovery protocol which distinguishes from other multipath routing protocols in that it is able to find multiple node-disjoint paths from every sensor node to the base station simultaneously in one route discovery process. Then we propose a hybrid multipath data collection scheme which combines end-to-end multipath traffic dispersion and per-hop alternate path salvaging. Our simulation results show that the proposed N-to-1 multipath discovery protocol is highly efficient and the hybrid data collection scheme based on it provides a seamlessly more reliable and more secure data collection service in wireless sensor networks.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, the classical least squares (LS) and recursive least squares (RLS) for parameter estimation have been re-examined in the light of the present day computing capabilities. It has been demonstrated that for linear time-invariant systems, the performance of blockwise least squares (BLS) is always superior to that of RLS. In the context of parameter estimation for dynamic systems, the current computational capability of personal computers are more than adequate for BLS. However, for time-varying systems with abrupt parameter changes, standard blockwise LS may no longer be suitable due to its inefficiency in discarding ''old'' data. To deal with this limitation, a novel sliding window blockwise least squares approach with automatically adjustable window length triggered by a change detection scheme is proposed. Two types of sliding windows, rectangular and exponential, have been investigated. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been illustrated by comparing with the standard RLS and an exponentially weighted RLS (EWRLS) using two examples. The simulation results have conclusively shown that: (1) BLS has better performance than RLS; (2) the proposed variable-length sliding window blockwise least squares (VLSWBLS) algorithm can outperform RLS with forgetting factors; (3) the scheme has both good tracking ability for abrupt parameter changes and can ensure the high accuracy of parameter estimate at the steady-state; and (4) the computational burden of VLSWBLS is completely manageable with the current computer technology. Even though the idea presented here is straightforward, it has significant implications to virtually all areas of application where RLS schemes are used.",

        "abstract":"As confirmed by theory and experiments, a key factor in successfully solving a supervised learning task, especially in the case that the hypothesis is highly complex, is the number of samples available to the learner. On the other hand, in real world applications, it may not be able to provide enough number of training samples to the learner because of high acquisition cost or incapability of obtaining samples. In this paper, we propose a method addressing the problem of learning with small sample set by generating additional virtual samples. In absence of any useful prior knowledge about the functional form of the target model, we take a closer look at the distribution patterns of available samples in low dimensional subspaces and constitute the rules that each sample, including virtual samples, must obey. These rules along with other problem constraints are used as weak conditions to refine the virtual samples through an optimization process. The method is applied to two real-world learning problems. The experimental results support the efficiency of the method for solving the small sample set problems.",

        "abstract":"In this paper we propose a new approach to the problem of estimating worst-case power consumption of CMOS combinational circuits based on neural models. Given the gate level description of a circuit, we build the corresponding neural network, we store it, we calculate the energy dissipated by the network and, finally, we derive the power dissipated by the original circuit. All the operations above are executed in the symbolic domain; that is, Algebraic Decision Diagrams are used to represent and manipulate the graph specification of the neural network modeling the circuit. We present preliminary results to show the feasibility of the method.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we study the use of adaptive modulation (AM) for a dual-hop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network with transmit antenna selection (TAS) at the transmitter and maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver. Our system deploys incremental amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying with AM to forward the source signal. A switching policy for selecting between the relaying and the direct communications is utilized to maximize spectrum efficiency. In particular, we derive expressions for the outage probability, spectrum efficiency, and bit error rate (BER) for the considered system over Nakagami-m fading. The considered network not only takes advantage of TAS transmission such as achieving full diversity order with low transmit complexity but also inherits the beneficial feature of AM such as spectrum efficiency improvement.",

        "abstract":"In the field of pattern recognition, the combination of an ensemble of neural networks has been proposed as an approach to the development of high performance image classification systems. However, previous work clearly showed that such image classification systems are effective only if the neural networks forming them make different errors. Therefore, the fundamental need for methods aimed to design ensembles of \u2018error-independent\u2019 networks is currently acknowledged. In this paper, an approach to the automatic design of effective neural network ensembles is proposed. Given an initial large set of neural networks, our approach is aimed to select the subset formed by the most error-independent nets. Reported results on the classification of multisensor remote-sensing images show that this approach allows one to design effective neural network ensembles.",

This paper presents a fast, efficient selection based system implemented on the DAP 510 for each of these query types. The DAP or the distributed array of processors is a commercially available array processor, a product of Active Memory Technology.

        "abstract":"We define a match join of R and S with predicate \u03b8 to be a subset of the \u03b8-join of R and S such that each tuple of R and S contributes to at most one result tuple. Match joins and their generalizations belong to a broad class of matching problems that have attracted a great deal of attention in disciplines including operations research and theoretical computer science. Instances of these problems arise in practice in resource allocation scenarios. To the best of our knowledge no one uses an RDBMS as a tool to help solve these problems; our goal in this paper is to explore whether or not this needs to be the case. We show that the simple approach of computing the full \u03b8-join and then applying standard graph-matching algorithms to the result is ineffective for all but the smallest of problem instances. By contrast, a closer study shows that the DBMS primitives of grouping, sorting, and joining can be exploited to yield efficient match join operations. This suggests that RDBMSs can play a role in matching related problems beyond merely serving as expensive file systems exporting data sets to external user programs.",

        "abstract":"We propose a resynthesis mthod that modifies a given circuit to reduce the number of paths in the circuit and thus improve its path delay fault testability. The resynthesis procedure is bawd on replacing subcircuits of the given circuit by structures called comparison units. A subcircuit can be replaced by a comparsion unit if it implements a function belonging to the class of comparison functions defined here. Comparison units are fully testable for stuck-at faults and for path delay faults. In addition, they have small numbers of paths and gates. These properties make them effective building blocks for resynthesis to improve the path delay fault testability of a ciruit. Experimental results demonstrate considerablereductions in the number of paths and increased path delay fault testability. These are achieved without increasing the number of gates, or the number of gates along the longest path in the circuit. The random pattern testability for stuck-at faults remains unchanged.",

        "abstract":"To measure and compare the clinical localization and registration errors in image-guided neurosurgery, with the purpose of revising current assumptions.Twelve patients who underwent brain surgeries with a navigation system were randomly selected. A neurosurgeon localized and correlated the landmarks on preoperative MRI images and on the intraoperative physical anatomy with a tracked pointer. In the laboratory, we generated 612 scenarios in which one landmark pair was defined as the target and the remaining ones were used to compute the registration transformation. Four errors were measured: (1) fiducial localization error (FLE); (2) target registration error (TRE); (3) fiducial registration error (FRE); (4) Fitzpatrick's target registration error estimation (F-TRE). We compared the different errors and computed their correlation.The image and physical FLE ranges were 0.5-2.0 and 1.6-3.0 mm, respectively. The measured TRE, FRE and F-TRE were 4.1 +\/- 1.6, 3.9 +\/- 1.2, and 3.7 +\/- 2.2 mm, respectively. Low correlations of 0.19 and 0.37 were observed between the FRE and TRE and between the F-TRE and the TRE, respectively. The differences of the FRE and F-TRE from the TRE were 1.3 +\/- 1.0 mm (max = 5.5 mm) and 1.3 +\/- 1.2 mm (max = 7.3 mm), respectively.Contrary to common belief, the FLE presents significant variations. Moreover, both the FRE and the F-TRE are poor indicators of the TRE in image-to-patient registration.",

        "abstract":"The availability of international standards based video codecs for inexpensive platforms is reducing the cost of desk-top video systems to a level which makes their wide deployment possible. The current systems, however, are tuned for processing a single video stream only and their use in multiple video applications, such as continuous presence video teleconferencing and digital picture-in-picture, is difficult and inefficient. In this paper, we discuss two systems for efficient generation and display of multi-resolution, multiple compressed video material. Based on simple additions to standard codecs, both systems are capable of generating multiple bit streams corresponding to different resolutions of a single video source and they can decode such streams from multiple sources and display the resulting video sequences simultaneously. Both systems provide multiple video functionality to standard codecs with almost no extra memory or processing power requirements. Also, they make it possible for the users to customize the placement and size of their video windows, just as text and graphics windows can be manipulated.",

        "abstract":"Multithreaded programs are notoriously prone to unintended interference between concurrent threads. To address this problem, we argue that yield annotations in the source code should document all thread interference, and we present a type system for verifying the absence of undocumented interference in Java programs. Under this type system, well-typed programs behave as if context switches occur only at yield annotations. Thus, well-typed programs can be understood using intuitive sequential reasoning, except where yield annotations remind the programmer to account for thread interference. Experimental results show that yield annotations describe thread interference more precisely than prior techniques based on method-level atomicity specifications. In particular, yield annotations reduce the number of interference points one must reason about by an order of magnitude. The type system is also more precise than prior methods targeting race freedom. Moreover, yield annotations serve to highlight all known concurrency defects in our benchmark suite.",

Recent HTML5 methods allow sampling a mobile phone's sensors from within web pages. Our objective is to leverage this for the creation of individual activity recognition modules that can be included into web applications to allow them to gain context-awareness. In this work, jActivity, a first prototype of such a platform-independent HTML5\/JavaScript framework is presented, along with experiments to determine the general feasibility and challenges for HAR in web applications. Our results indicate that the realization looks promising, albeit so far limited to certain devices\/user agents.",

        "abstract":"Image subtraction makes it possible to enhance the visibility of the difference between two images. This technique has been used in digital subtraction angiography (DSA) that is a well established modality for the visualization of coronary arteries. DSA involves the subtraction of a mask image \u2013 an image of the heart before injection of contrast medium \u2013 from live image. A serious disadvantage of this method, inherent to the subtraction operation, is sensitivity to distortion and variance of background gray-level intensity. Among the causes of these distortions are mean gray-level shift, and motions of heart and lung. In this paper, by choosing the image that has the minimum distortion through similarity analysis of background texture, we suggest the way to solve fundamental problems caused by background distortion, and then how to segment vessel from colony angiography through local gray-level correction of selected image.",

        "abstract":"We present a design of a complete and practical scheduler for the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) downlink by integrating recent results on resource allocation, fast computational algorithms, and scheduling. Our scheduler has low computational complexity. We define the computational architecture and describe the exact computations that need to be done at each time step (1 milliseconds). Our computational framework is very general, and can be used to implement a wide variety of scheduling rules. For LTE, we provide quantitative performance results for our scheduler for full buffer, streaming video (with loose delay constraints), and live video (with tight delay constraints). Simulations are performed by selectively abstracting the PHY layer, accurately modeling the MAC layer, and following established network evaluation methods. The numerical results demonstrate that queue- and channel-aware QoS schedulers can and should be used in an LTE downlink to offer QoS to a diverse mix of traffic, including delay-sensitive flows. Through these results and via theoretical analysis, we illustrate the various design tradeoffs that need to be made in the selection of a specific queue-and-channel-aware scheduling policy. Moreover, the numerical results show that in many scenarios strict prioritization across traffic classes is suboptimal.",

        "abstract":"Finding approximate Nash equilibria in bimatrix games is one of the main open\nproblems in algorithmic game theory. Motivated in part by the lack of progress\non worst case instances, Awasthi et. al [2] proposed the question of finding\napproximate Nash equilibria in games that satisfy a natural stability to\napproximation condition. In this paper, we substantially generalize their\nresults, provide the first lower bounds known for such games, and develop\nconnections to other interesting notions of stability. Our first main\ncontribution is to show that the main upper bound of Awasthi et. al applies to\na substantially more general stability condition. In particular, rather than\nassuming that there exists a fixed Nash equilibrium (p*,q*) such that all\nepsilon-approximate equilibria are contained in a ball of radius Delta around\n(p*,q*), we require only that for any well supported epsilon-approximate\nequilibrium (p,q) there exists a Nash equilibrium (p*,q*) that is Delta-close\nto (p,q). We show that the main upper bound of Awasthi et. al applies to this\nstrict generalization as long as the game has at most n^{O((Delta\/epsilon)^2)}\nNash equilibria. Our generalized notion of approximation stability turns out to\nbe equivalent to a stability to perturbations condition, stating that any Nash\nequilibrium in a slightly perturbed game is close to a Nash equilibrium in the\noriginal game. This condition is similar to the stability notion proposed by\nLipton et al [18] for economic solution concepts, and it is clearly a desirable\ncondition, since in many cases of interest the game analyzed is only an\napproximation of the game actually being played. Our second main result shows\nthat the interesting range of parameters for the (epsilon, Delta)- stability\ncondition of Awasthi et. al (and for all the other relaxations of this\ncondition that we analyze) is Delta = O(\\epsilon^{1\/4}).",

        "abstract":"The shallow water equations describe motions in a shallow, incompressible and nonviscous fluid layer on the rotating Earth. Due to their relative simplicity, they are widely used for testing and analysing new numerical methods developed for weather prediction models. In this paper, we apply different operator splittings, based on directional decomposition, to the linearised form of the shallow water equations obtained by the method of small perturbations. This system has three types of harmonic wave solutions with known dispersion relations and phase velocities. We investigate how the application of operator splitting modifies these important characteristics, and compare the performance of different splitting methods from this point of view.",

        "abstract":"Advancing our knowledge about cues to deception is crucial to successful deception detection. A lengthy list of cues to deception has been identified via a myriad of deception studies. Nonetheless, we identified two major limitations of existing cues to deception: the lack of cues in computer-mediated communication and in non-Western group communication. In this research, we aim to make some contributions to addressing this line of inquiry. We conducted an empirical study on cues to deception using a large real-world online Chinese community. Through hypotheses testing, we observed a number of interesting findings. For example, we found that deceivers tended to communicate less and showed low complexity and high diversity in their messages. These findings provide significant implications to deception research and the broad online communication community.",

        "abstract":"This paper develops a modeling and computational framework for supply chain networks with global outsourcing and quick-response production under demand and cost uncertainty. Our model considers multiple off-shore suppliers, multiple manufacturers, and multiple demand markets. Using variational inequality theory, we formulate the governing equilibrium conditions of the competing decision-makers (the manufacturers) who are faced with two-stage stochastic programming problems but who also have to cooperate with the other decision-makers (the off-shore suppliers). Our theoretical and analytical results shed light on the value of outsourcing from novel real option perspectives. Moreover, our simulation studies reveal important managerial insights regarding how demand and cost uncertainty affects the profits, the risks, as well as the global outsourcing and quick-production decisions of supply chain firms under competition.",

The relationship between the volume of the data transmitted and the transmission time is tested and the analysis of the data shows that there is a significant linear relationship between the two. Then we give an implemen-tation plan of the parallel genetic algorithm (PGA), and we also carried on the computation of a TSP example which shows a higher speedup and a better per-formance. All these show that the it is efficient and effective to use MATLAB to develop distributed computing application program.",

        "abstract":"Internet resources are not yet machine-understandable resources. To address this problem a number of studies have been done. One such a study is the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which has been supported by World-Wide Web (WWW) Consortium. The DC (Dublin Core) metadata elements have been defined using the property of extensibility of RDF to handle electronic metadata information. In this article, an authoring editor, called H-DCEdit, is introduced. This editor makes use of RDF\/DC model to define contents of Turkish electronic resources. To serialize (or to code) a RDF model, SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) has been used. In addition to this work, a possible view of RDF\/DC documents is provided using Document Style Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL) standard. HDCEdit supports use of Turkish language in describing Internet resources. Isite\/Isearch system developed Center for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR) organization with respect to Z.39.50 standard is able to index documents and allows one to query the indexed terms in tagged elements (e.g., terms in RDF\/DC elements). In the scope of our work, the localization of this Isite\/Isearch system is completed in terms of sorting, comparison, and stemming. The feature of supporting queries over tags provides basis for integrating H-DCEdit authoring tool with Isite\/Isearch search engine.",

Cardinality and characteristics of the set, together with volatility of the information, resulting from fast and continuous creation, deletion and updating of entries, trigger novel research questions. In this context, we plan to investigate and contribute to the data analysis, and user interface design of exploratory experiences. The proposed approach is an iterative process where analysis and design phases are performed in cycles. The long-term vision is to understand the underlying reasoning in order to be able to automatically replicate it.",

During training, the fuzzy c-means algorithm is initially used to form the clusters in the cluster layer; then the evolutionary algorithm is employed to optimize those clusters and their parameters. During testing, the class whose cluster node returns the maximum output value is the result of the prediction. This proposed model has been benchmarked against the standard backpropagation neural network, the fuzzy ARTMAP, C4.5, and CART. The results on six benchmark problems are very encouraging.",

        "abstract":"Modelling at the Electronic System Level (ESL) is the established approach of the major System-on-chip (SoC) companies. While in the past ESL design covered design method- ologies only, today also verification and debugging is included. To improve the verification process, testbench automation has been introduced highlighted as constraint-based random simulation. In SystemC - the de facto standard modelling language for ESL - constraint-based random simulation is available through the SystemC Verification (SCV) library. However, the underlying constraint-solver is based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and hence suffers from memory problems. In this paper, we propose the integration of new techniques for stimuli generation based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Since SMT solvers are designed to determine a single satisfying solution only, several strategies are proposed forcing the solver to generate more than one stimuli from different parts of the search space. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach and the developed strategies in comparison to the original BDD-based method. Keywords-Constraint-based random simulation, SAT Modulo",

        "abstract":"  This paper proposes simple moment based spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio networks in a flat fading channel. It is assumed that the transmitted signal samples are binary (quadrature) phase-shift keying BPSK (QPSK), Mary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or continuous uniformly distributed random variables and the noise samples are independent and identically distributed circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variables all with unknown (imperfect) variance. Under these assumptions, we propose a simple test statistics employing a ratio of fourth and second moments. For this statistics, we provide analytical expressions for both probability of false alarm (Pf) and probability of detection (Pd) in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.We confirm the theoretical expressions by computer simulation. Furthermore, under noise variance uncertainty, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed moment based detector gives better detection performance compared to that of energy detector in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.

If virtual systems are to be effective and well received by their users, considerable human-factors research needs to be accomplished. This paper provides an overview of many of these human-factors issues, including human performance efficiency in virtual worlds (which is likely influenced by task characteristics, user characteristics, human sensory and motor physiology, multimodal interaction, and the potential need for new design metaphors); health and safety issues (of which cybersickness and deleterious physiological aftereffects may pose the most concern); and the social impact of the technology. The challenges each of these factors present to the effective design of virtual environments and systematic approaches to the resolution of each of these issues are discussed.",

The MIMF offers to use a statistical method in order to analyze the impulsive behavior of pixels. The experimental results show that the MIMF achieves superior restoration performance compared to the other filters mentioned in this paper with regard to noise suppression and detail preservation, especially when the noise density is very high.

        "abstract":"Lipids are an important and highly diverse class of molecules having structural, energy storage and signaling roles. Modern analytical technologies afford screening of many lipid molecular species in parallel. One of the biggest challenges of lipidomics is elucidation of important pathobiological phenomena from the integration of the large amounts of new data becoming available.We present computational and informatics approaches to study lipid molecular profiles in the context of known metabolic pathways and established pathophysiological responses, utilizing information obtained from modern analytical technologies. In order to facilitate identification of lipids, we compute the scaffold of theoretically possible lipids based on known lipid building blocks such as polar head groups and fatty acids. Each compound entry is linked to the available information on lipid pathways and contains the information that can be utilized for its automated identification from high-throughput UPLC\/MS-based lipidomics experiments. The utility of our approach is demonstrated by its application to the lipidomic characterization of the fatty liver of the genetically obese insulin resistant ob\/ob mouse model. We investigate the changes of correlation structure of the lipidome using multivariate analysis, as well as reconstruct the pathways for specific molecular species of interest using available lipidomic and gene expression data.The methodology presented herein facilitates identification and interpretation of high-throughput lipidomics data. In the context of the ob\/ob mouse liver profiling, we have identified the parallel associations between the elevated triacylglycerol levels and the ceramides, as well as the putative activated ceramide-synthesis pathways.",

        "abstract":"Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architectures for content and knowledge management enable autonomous peers to interoperate in a decentralized and distributed fashion for fulfilling individual and\/or common goals. These architectures foster the creation of communities of Individual Knowledge Workers (IKWs) in which effective knowledge and information sharing takes place. In such communities, IKWs have similar capabilities in providing other IKWs with data and\/or services and are autonomous in managing their own knowledge objects. Since such objects are typically shared among a set of IKWs, problems regarding concurrent access to content, content consistency and synchronization arise. This paper proposes a decentralized approach to the aforementioned issues and reports on its application and performance evaluation in the K-link+ system. K-link+ is a P2P collaborative platform, developed at the GridLab of the University of Calabria, for distributed knowledge management based on the Virtual Office model.",

        "abstract":"In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the equally-powered pilots (EPP) scheme is known to provide the best channel estimation performance when the channel status is unknown. In this study, it is shown that if we assume the channel correlation function (CCF) of a quasistatic channel is perfectly known at the receiver, all of the available pilot power should be allocated to the pilot sub-carrier with the maximum channel amplitude. In addition, a practical water-filling-type power allocation scheme, designated as the gain-powered pilots (GPP) scheme, is proposed for the case in which the CCF is subject to a certain amount of error. The simulation results indicate that the GPP scheme consistently outperforms the EPP method in terms of improving the performance of the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimator.",

        "abstract":"With an increasing number of small-scale renewable generator installations, distribution network planners are faced with new technical challenges (intermittent load flows, network imbalances...). Then again, these decentralized generators (DGs) present opportunities regarding savings on network infrastructure if installed at strategic locations. How can we consider both of these aspects when building decision tools for planning future distribution networks? This paper presents a simulation framework which combines two modeling techniques: agent-based modeling (ABM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). ABM is used to represent the different system units of the network accurately and dynamically, simulating over short time-periods. PSO is then used to find the most economical configuration of DGs over longer periods of time. The infrastructure of the framework is introduced, presenting the two modeling techniques and their integration. A case study of Townsville, Australia, is then used to illustrate the platform implementation and the outputs of a simulation.",

        "abstract":"Collaborative Virtual Work Groups (CVWG) are small groups of people that work together but are distanced geographically, temporarily or organisationally, keeping their connections through technologies like groupware. Groupware enables a shared environment for CVWG and informs its state and changes through a mechanism called Awareness. When Awareness notifies users about changes automatically, it can overload users. We argue that the relevance of these changes can be inferred from the semantics of user actions taking into consideration an interpretation context (work context) and the state of users when being notified (user context). This approach allows us to control and deliver notifications ubiquitously and to encapsulate this behavior in an awareness server so that classic groupware applications can be adapted to benefit from this behavior. The mechanism is a Multi-Agent System (MAS) with a rule-based reasoning approach. We briefly discuss the experience we obtained when building applications over this mechanism.",

        "abstract":"Based on the backstepping technique, a direct adaptive neural network control algorithm is proposed for a class of uncertain nonlinear discrete-time systems in the strict-feedback form. Neural networks are utilized to approximate unknown functions, and a stable adaptive neural backstepping controller is synthesized. It is proven that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of zero by choosing the design parameters appropriately. Compared with the existing results for discrete-time systems, the proposed algorithm needs only less parameters to be adjusted online, therefore, it can reduce online computation burden. A simulation example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract":"Background: The structure annotation of a genome is based either on ab initio methodologies or on similaritiy searches versus molecules that have been already annotated. Ab initio gene predictions in a genome are based on a priori knowledge of species-specific features of genes. The training of ab initio gene finders is based on the definition of a data-set of gene models. To accomplish this task the common approach is to align species-specific full length cDNA and EST sequences along the genomic sequences in order to define exon\/intron structure of mRNA coding genes. Results: GeneModelEST is the software here proposed for defining a data-set of candidate gene models using exclusively evidence derived from cDNA\/EST sequences. GeneModelEST requires the genome coordinates of the spliced-alignments of ESTs and of contigs (tentative consensus sequences) generated by an EST clustering\/assembling procedure to be formatted in a General Feature Format (GFF) standard file. Moreover, the alignments of the contigs versus a protein database are required as an NCBI BLAST formatted report file. The GeneModelEST analysis aims to i) evaluate each exon as defined from contig spliced alignments onto the genome sequence; ii) classify the contigs according to quality levels in order to select candidate gene models; iii) assign to the candidate gene models preliminary functional annotations. We discuss the application of the proposed methodology to build a data-set of gene models of Solanum lycopersicum, whose genome sequencing is an ongoing effort by the International Tomato Genome Sequencing",

        "abstract":"An image-based visual servo control is presented for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of stationary or quasi-stationary flight with the camera mounted onboard the vehicle. The target considered consists of a finite set of stationary and disjoint points lying in a plane. Control of the position and orientation dynamics is decoupled using a visual error based on spherical centroid data, along with estimations of the linear velocity and the gravitational inertial direction extracted from image features and an embedded inertial measurement unit. The visual error used compensates for poor conditioning of the image Jacobian matrix by introducing a nonhomogeneous gain term adapted to the visual sensitivity of the error measurements. A nonlinear controller, that ensures exponential convergence of the system considered, is derived for the full dynamics of the system using control Lyapunov function design techniques. Experimental results on a quadrotor UAV, developed by the French Atomic Energy Commission, demonstrate the robustness and performance of the proposed control strategy.",

        "abstract":"Ambient Intelligence is an emerging research field that aims to make many of the everyday activities of people easier and more efficient. This new paradigm gives rise to opportunities for novel, more efficient interactions with computing systems. At a technical level, the vision of Ambient Intelligence is realized by the seamless confluence of diverse computing platforms. In this context, a software framework (middleware) is essential to enable heterogeneous computing systems to interoperate. In this paper we first consider the basic requirements of a middleware that can effectively support the construction of Ambient Intelligence environments. Subsequently, we present a brief survey of existing, general-purpose middleware systems and evaluate them in terms of their suitability for serving as the low-level communication platform of an Ambient Intelligence middleware. Finally, we argue that an Object-Oriented middleware such as the Common Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is most suited for basing a middleware for Ambient Intelligence environments.",

        "abstract":"This paper presents a literature review of the application of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to important problems in medical and health care decision making. The literature is classified by year of publication, health care category, journal, method of analyzing alternatives, participants, and application type. Very few articles were published prior to 1988 and the level of activity has increased to about three articles per year since 1997. The 50 articles reviewed were classified in seven categories: diagnosis, patient participation, therapy\/treatment, organ transplantation, project and technology evaluation and selection, human resource planning, and health care evaluation and policy. The largest number of articles was found in the project and technology evaluation and selection category (14) with substantial activity in patient participation (9), therapy\/treatment (8), and health care evaluation and policy (8). The AHP appears to be a promising support tool for shared decision making between patient and doctor, evaluation and selection of therapies and treatments, and the evaluation of health care technologies and policies. We expect that AHP research will continue to be an important component of health care and medical research.",

        "abstract":"Many examples exist of multivariate time series where dependencies between variables change over time. If these changing dependencies are not taken into account, any model that is learnt from the data will average over the different dependency structures. Paradigms that try to explain underlying processes and observed events in multivariate time series must explicitly model these changes in order to allow non-experts to analyse and understand such data. In this paper we have developed a method for generating explanations in multivariate time series that takes into account changing dependency structure. We make use of a dynamic Bayesian network model with hidden nodes. We introduce a representation and search technique for learning such models from data and test it on synthetic time series and real-world data from an oil refinery, both of which contain changing underlying structure. We compare our method to an existing EM-based method for learning structure. Results are very promising for our method and we include sample explanations, generated from models learnt from the refinery dataset.",

In order to effectively balance upper and lower risk, reasonably share the benefits, considering the contribution of the earning profits, cooperation risks and investment costs based on Shapley value method, this paper determines the weight of each evaluation index by fuzzy mathematics theory. A model for benefit compensation of construction diversion in upstream flood discharge control, which can estimate quantitatively the compensation, was proposed. An illustrative example that Fen man diversion system reconstruction controlled flood discharge by Baishan Hydropower Station is given to show the method, which objectively reflects individual contributions, provides a feasible basis of realizing benefit sharing and compensation between upstream and downstream power stations.",

        "abstract":"To maximise the energy collected by a given photovoltaic system (PVS), it is important to track the position of the sun so that the PV panels are exposed to the maximum global radiation at any given time. Thus, it is useful to determine the direction of the maximum global radiation, which does not correspond with the condition of orthogonality between the plane of the array and the beam component of the solar radiation. Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate a low-cost solar radiation sensing system that can determine this direction. The proposed system consists of a structure of nine photodiodes (FDs); a suitable analysis of the output signals calculates the azimuth and solar height angles, which are related to the direction of maximum solar irradiance. This paper reports the development of hardware (HW) and software (SW) for a prototype system, which is called SoliSector. Outdoor experimental results regarding testing and calibration of the proposed system are also reported.",

For this reason, many MANET emulators have been proposed so far. However, these emulators have some drawbacks and advantages. In this article, a new emulator is proposed to effectively test service programs for MANET. Moreover, we implemented the emulator to evaluate the performance and to compare it with existing emulators. The comparative results show that the proposed emulator can realize more efficient and larger range of the test.",

        "abstract":"Michigan-style Classifier Systems use Genetic Algorithms to facilitate rule-discovery. This paper presents a simple Markov model of the algorithm in such systems, with the aim of examining the effects of different types of interdependence between niches in multi-step tasks. Using the model it is shown that the existence of, what is here termed, partner rule variance can have significant and detrimental effects on the Genetic Algorithm's expected behaviour. Suggestions are made as to how to reduce these effects, making connections with other recent work in the area.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we describe a novel turbo encoding and iterative decoding scheme based on the concept of switched interleaving and transmission of side information. The proposed system consists of an innovative structure for turbo encoding that allows the refinement of the code words produced with the use of a codebook with different and appropriately designed interleavers. We also develop two search procedures to infer the best interleaver in the codebook with the aid of side information containing the index of the interleaver sent to the decoder via a novel embedded transmission. At the decoder the selected interleaver is employed in the decoding procedure. The proposed system allows a significant refinement and improvement of conventional turbo codes, resulting in considerable performance improvements for short blocks and lower error floors than the existing state-of-the-art techniques.",

Using a self-correcting parameter, calculated by using Newton\u2019s interpolatory polynomial of second degree, the R-order of convergence is increased from 2 to 3. This acceleration of the convergence rate is attained without any additional function calculations, which provides a very high computational efficiency of the proposed method. Another advantage is the convenient fact that this method does not use derivatives. Numerical examples are included to confirm the theoretical results and high computational efficiency.",

Main focus of OSSS lies in the field of hardware design and in synthesis capability. The strategy is based on an extension of the synthesizable subset of standard SystemC. The approach supports real object-oriented and synthesizable design features like classes, inheritance, templates, polymorphism and global object access. Therefore OSSS promises high efficiency in senseof capability to handle complex designs, faster development time, improved code quality and faster time to market. In contrast, standard SystemC is also based on C++ constructs, but no object-oriented constructs are available yet for a synthesizable system description.We have evaluated OSSS on an automotive design example. It was chosen for the implementation of a component that is part of all video projects: A camera's exposure control unit (ExpoCU). The first main goal that was achieved is a synthesizable design by the automatic generation of an FPGA netlist from an OSSS description. Furthermore we have also proved the methodology to fulfill industrial requirements such as usability for complex system development, integration of existing IP, improved code quality and decreased development effort. Comparison will be done against existing VHDL based design flow. We especially focus on the implementation and testability by comparing the new object-oriented synthesis approach with a standard VHDL flow by laying emphasis on synthesizability.OSSS and equivalent kinds of methodology show a large potential to handle new generations of complex HW-SW systems. Moreover the gap between increasing design complexity and available methodologies already now gets bigger and bigger and thus needs to be closed by new solutions such as OSSS.",

        "abstract":"Feature selection is a useful pre-processing technique for solving classification problems. The challenge of solving the feature selection problem lies in applying evolutionary algorithms capable of handling the huge number of features typically involved. Generally, given classification data may contain useless, redundant or misleading features. To increase classification accuracy, the primary objective is to remove irrelevant features in the feature space and to correctly identify relevant features. Binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) has been applied successfully to solving feature selection problems. In this paper, two kinds of chaotic maps-so-called logistic maps and tent maps-are embedded in BPSO. The purpose of chaotic maps is to determine the inertia weight of the BPSO. We propose chaotic binary particle swarm optimization (CBPSO) to implement the feature selection, in which the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) serves as a classifier for evaluating classification accuracies. The proposed feature selection method shows promising results with respect to the number of feature subsets. The classification accuracy is superior to other methods from the literature.",

One way of achieving these goals is illustrated by the methods adopted for TRAC T-64 interactive language, and its related family of languages. Oppressive rigidity usually associated with standardization is avoided by a new accommodation technique accessible to the user to allow local variations within the language. Explicit standardization of the language is undertaken at the organizational source of the language. Use of the organizational trademark (TRAC) on the published standards, and services relying upon them, provides a reliable public identification. These methods can be useful applied to other programming languages and computer services.",

        "abstract":"This paper provides a unified solution for the attitude and position tracking problem of a rigid body in 3-dimensional space, using the concept of the unit dual quaternion. The error dynamics described by a unit dual quaternion are deduced after the dual-quaternion-based dynamics of a single rigid body are given. Then by utilizing the feedback linearization principle, a unit dual quaternion based tracker is proposed based on the error dynamics, which is proven to render the equilibrium point of the closed loop system asymptotically stable, and includes the attitude and position regulation problems as particular cases. Furthermore, to solve the two equilibria problem, a switching parameter is introduced to improve the tracker, which causes the system to converge to the \u2018nearer\u2019 equilibrium with a \u2018shorter\u2019 path. Both the trackers uniquely deal with the rotational and translational dynamics simultaneously with non-singularity and maintain the interconnection between rotation and translation. Finally, the proposed control schemes with applications to the regulation problem and the tracking problem are simulated to illustrate the theoretical results.",

        "abstract":"The paper concerns device discovery in multi-hop networks of Bluetooth devices. We start from the observation that forming a Bluetooth scatternet (i.e., a multi-hop wireless topology) requires each pair of neighboring nodes to have a \"symmetric\" knowledge of each other, i.e., if node u knows node v then note v know note u. We investigate the use of the Bluetooth procedures for device discovery (inquiry procedures) in order to guarantee the needed symmetric knowledge for scatternet formation. Through the use of simulations we observed that despite the long time required for each node to become aware of the presence of all its neighbors, the Bluetooth topologies obtained bu using the devices dicovered after just 6 seconds are connected. The average number of neighbors of each node and the average route length are also consistently colse to the values that we would obtain if all the neighbors of a device were discovered.",

        "abstract":"In the area of Bio robotics, intense research work is going on in plant intelligence. Any living cell continuously receives information from the environment. The plant electrical signal is the reaction of plants to the stimulation due to various environmental conditions. Action potentials are responsible for signaling between plant cells because they can be induced and transmitted rapidly within the plant tissue. Communication from the plants can be achieved through modulation of the amplitude, frequency change, and change in resistance and the rate of propagation of the electrical signal in the plant tissue. In this paper research is conducted on the plant signals and its response to various environments. The change of frequency of action potential signals in plant named Pepe (Descoingsii x hawothioides) under different light modes are studied. Electromyography (EMG) electrodes and Needle type conductive electrodes along with electronic modules are used to collect and transform the information from the plants. Analysis on the plant signal has been carried out. Inverse Fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is used to convert frequency to voltage signal. The change in frequency of the plant action potential signals to different light modes are used for the control of the Bio-machine. The present work paved an extensive research towards plant intelligence. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.",

In particular, a novel approach that performs joint spatial and temporal prediction simultaneously is introduced. It bypasses the complex H.26x interframe techniques and it is less computationally intensive. Because of the advantage of the effective joint prediction and the image-dependent color space transformation (KLT), the proposed approach is demonstrated experimentally to consistently lead to improved video quality, and in many cases to better compression rates and improved computational speed.",

        "abstract":"SAR tomography (SARTom) is an imaging technique that allows multiple phase center separation in the vertical direction, leading to a 3-D reconstruction of the imaged scene. The retrieval of volume structure information (e.g., for forest classification) and the solution of the layover problem are two of the most promising applications. In this letter, SARTom, in combination with polarimetry (PolSARTom), is exploited to image and to extract characteristic features (e.g., shape and height) of targets hidden beneath foliage. This analysis is applied to L-band airborne data acquired by the E-SAR system of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) during a tomographic campaign that took place in September 2006 on the test site of Dornstetten (Germany).",

        "abstract":"EMAGE (http:\/\/www.emouseatlas.org\/emage\/) is a freely available database of in situ gene expression patterns that allows users to perform online queries of mouse developmental gene expression. EMAGE is unique in providing both text-based descriptions of gene expression plus spatial maps of gene expression patterns. This mapping allows spatial queries to be accomplished alongside more traditional text-based queries. Here, we describe our recent progress in spatial mapping and data integration. EMAGE has developed a method of spatially mapping 3D embryo images captured using optical projection tomography, and through the use of an IIP3D viewer allows users to view arbitrary sections of raw and mapped 3D image data in the context of a web browser. EMAGE now includes enhancer data, and we have spatially mapped images from a comprehensive screen of transgenic reporter mice that detail the expression of mouse non-coding genomic DNA fragments with enhancer activity. We have integrated the eMouseAtlas anatomical atlas and the EMAGE database so that a user of the atlas can query the EMAGE database easily. In addition, we have extended the atlas framework to enable EMAGE to spatially cross-index EMBRYS whole mount in situ hybridization data. We additionally report on recent developments to the EMAGE web interface, including new query and analysis capabilities.",

To deal with this problem, we propose a method for the analysis of genetic regulatory networks under parameter uncertainty. We consider models based on piecewise-multiaffine differential equations, dynamical properties expressed in temporal logic, and intervals for the values of uncertain parameters. The problem is then either to guarantee that the system satisfies the expected properties for every possible parameter value\u2014the corresponding parameter set is then called valid\u2014or to find valid subsets of a given parameter set. The proposed method uses discrete abstractions and model checking and allows for efficient search of the parameter space. However, the abstraction process creates spurious behaviors in the abstract systems, along which time does not progress. Consequently, the verification of liveness properties, expressing that something will eventually happen, and implicitly assuming progress of time, often fails. A solution to this second problem is proposed using the notion of transient regions. This approach has been implemented in a tool for robust verification of gene networks and applied to the tuning of a synthetic network built in E. coli.",

We derive a general order theory for these schemes in terms of $B$-series and bicolored rooted trees. To ease the construction of specific schemes we generalize an idea of Zennaro [{\\em {Math. Comp.,}} 46 (1986), pp. 119--133] and define natural continuous extensions in the context of exponential integrators. This leads to a relatively easy derivation of some of the most popular recently proposed schemes. The general format of schemes considered here makes use of coefficient functions which will usually be selected from some finite dimensional function spaces. We will derive lower bounds for the dimension of these spaces in terms of the order of the resulting schemes. Finally, we illustrate the presented ideas by giving examples of new exponential integrators of orders 4 and 5.",

        "abstract":"Decision tree construction is a well studied problem in data mining. Recently, there has been much interest in mining streaming data. Domingos and Hulten have presented a one-pass algorithm for decision tree construction. Their work uses Hoeffding inequality to achieve a probabilistic bound on the accuracy of the tree constructed.In this paper, we revisit this problem. We make the following two contributions: 1) We present a numerical interval pruning (NIP) approach for efficiently processing numerical attributes. Our results show an average of 39% reduction in execution times. 2) We exploit the properties of the gain function entropy (and gini) to reduce the sample size required for obtaining a given bound on the accuracy. Our experimental results show a 37% reduction in the number of data instances required.",

        "abstract":"Hard-margin support vector machines (HM-SVMs) suffer from getting overfitting in the presence of noise. Soft-margin SVMs deal with this problem by introducing a regularization term and obtain a state-of-the-art performance. However, this disposal leads to a relatively high computational cost. In this paper, an alternative method, greedy stagewise algorithm for SVMs, named GS-SVMs, is presented to cope with the overfitting of HM-SVMs without employing the regularization term. The most attractive property of GS-SVMs is that its computational complexity in the worst case only scales quadratically with the size of training samples. Experiments on the large data sets with up to 400,000 training samples demonstrate that GS-SVMs can be faster than LIBSVM 2.83 without sacrificing the accuracy. Finally, we employ statistical learning theory to analyze the empirical results, which shows that the success of GS-SVMs lies in that its early stopping rule can act as an implicit regularization term.",

        "abstract":"The thermal resistance of the first-level Cu dissipation substrate (RCu) with different Cu thickness is investigated in this work. Using the \u201cconstant-forward-voltage\u201d method, the thermal resistances of the first-level Cu dissipation substrates (RCu) were measured against different Cu thickness. In the initial increase in the Cu thickness (up to 0.6mm), RCu decreases with the Cu thickness. As the Cu thickness over 0.6mm, RCu starts to slightly increase with the Cu thickness. The thermal resistance (RCu) of the Cu substrate is composed of the z-direction thermal resistance (Rz) and the two-dimensional horizontal spreading resistance (Rs). The initial decrease in RCu should attribute to the decrease in Rs with the Cu thickness. After the initial increase in RCu, the RCu would increase and be dominated by the Rz increase with the Cu thickness. Intriguingly, a minimum RCu value occurs at the Cu thickness of about 0.6mm. Also, in this paper, we discuss the possible inaccuracy factors of the \u201cconstant-forward-voltage\u201d method.",

It is shown that the spatial power spectrum of the motion-compensated prediction error can be calculated from the signal power spectrum and the displacement estimation error p.d.f.. A spatial Wiener filter can improve the efficiency of motion-compensating prediction. Memoryless encoding of the motion-compensated prediction error and intraframe encoding of the motion-compensated prediction error are compared. An evaluation of the rate-distortion functions for a typical videoconference sampling format shows that for integer pel accuracy of the displacement estimate the additional gain by motion-compensating prediction over pure intraframe coding is limited to \u223c 0.8 bits\/sample in moving areas. Required accuracies of the displacement estimate for a gain of motion-compensating interframe coding over intraframe coding are given.",

        "abstract":"We present a novel method for correcting the significance level of hypothesis testing that requires multiple comparisons.\n It is based on the spectral graph theory, in which the variables are seen as the vertices of a complete undirected graph and\n the correlation matrix as the adjacency matrix that weights its edges. The method increases the statistical power of the analysis\n by refuting the assumption of independence among variables, while keeping the probability of false positives low. By computing\n the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix, it is possible to obtain valuable information about the dependence levels among\n the variables of the problem, so that the effective number of independent variables can be estimated. The method is compared\n to other available models and its effectiveness illustrated in case studies involving high-dimensional sets of variables.",

        "abstract":"Energy use in the home is a topic of increasing interest and concern, and one on which technology can have a significant impact. However, existing work typically focuses on moderately affluent homeowners who have relative autonomy with respect to their home, or does not address socio-economic status, class, and other related issues. For the 30% of the U.S. population who rent their homes, many key decisions regarding energy use must be negotiated with a landlord. Because energy use impacts the bottom line of both landlords and tenants, this can be a source of conflict in the landlord\/tenant relationship. Ubicomp technologies for reducing energy use in rental units must engage with landlord\/tenant conflicts to be successful. Unfortunately, little detailed knowledge is available about the impact of landlord\/tenant conflicts on energy use. We present an analysis of a series of qualitative studies with landlords and tenants. We argue that a consideration of multiple stakeholders, and the power imbalances among them, will drive important new research questions and lead to more widely applicable solutions. The main contribution of our work is a set of open research questions and design recommendations for technologies that may affect and be affected by the conflict between stakeholders around energy use.",

        "abstract":"WWW (World Wide Web) has become the richest resource pool of services and information. By integrating the existing independent services in WWW, users can compose and create abundant new services, such as stock alert service, automatic trading service. Due to the characteristics of internet -- wide-area distribution, lack of referential integrity and no quality of service, how to assure the reliability and accuracy of execution of new composed services is very important and indispensable. In this paper, we analyze the possible causes of exceptions and their solutions in WWW service integration and then design and implement the exception handling mechanisms in our WWW Service Integration Tool.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, we examine a method in which distinctive mouth shapes are processed using a computer. When lip-reading skill holders do lip-reading, they stare at the changes in mouth shape of a speaker. In recent years, some researches into lip-reading using information technology has been pursued. There are some researches based on the changes in mouth shape. The researchers analyze all data of the mouth shapes during an utterance, whereas lip-reading skill holders look at distinctive mouth shapes. We found that there was a high possibility for lip-reading by using the distinctive mouth shapes. To build the technique into a lip-reading system, we propose an expression method of the distinctive mouth shapes which can be processed using a computer. In this way, we acquire knowledge about the relation between Japanese phones and mouth shapes. We also propose a method to express order of the distinctive mouth shapes which are formed by a speaker.",

        "abstract":"Lambda-Grids are richly interconnected collections of plentiful, geographically-distributed computing and storage resources. This rich connectivity is enabled by dedicated dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) optical paths. With abundant bandwidth in the center of the network (many DWDM links), contention and sharing bottlenecks move from the network core to end systems. In such networks, traditional TCP is insufficient to provide acceptable performance. We identify the key communication characteristics of this radically different network, introducing a new multipoint-to-point communication pattern for data-intensive application. We evaluate several promising rate-based data transport protocols (RBUDP, SABUL\/UDT and GTP) for lambda-Grids under a range of communication patterns (single stream, multiple parallel streams, converging streams, and rapid transitions). Our experiments use a range of performance metrics, including sustained throughput and loss rate, inter- and intra-protocol fairness, protocol overhead, and rate adaptation speed to flow transitions. The results provide insights into the capabilities of these three protocols and also for improvements in design and implementation of rate-based protocols.",

For this reason, synthesis of the logic gate fanout structure is of paramount importance during performance optimization. This paper presents a methodology for on-chip RC interconnect synthesis. Moment sensitivities are used to vary the wire widths of the branches in an RC interconnect tree to achieve performance targets. In this paper, signal slopes and delays at critical fanout nodes are the targets, and the impact on total metal area is considered. An O(MN2) procedure for computing the exact moment sensitivities in an RC tree is described.",

        "abstract":"This article introduces an approach to text visualization by colors. I suggest a color code that displays word classes: noun (black), verb (red), adjective (green), determiner (grey), particle (brown), conjunction (blue), and interjection (yellow). The colored words provide some details about 1. text genre, 2. sentence structure, and 3. writing style. Samples with fictional narratives and scientific articles (both in German) show that fictional texts have a brighter color pattern compared to scientific texts. The color pattern might be related to the hidden sound or melody of a text. Therefore, text visualization could be useful both as a future method to analyze different text genres and as a method helping laypersons getting a better feeling for texts, identifying troublesome phrases, and perhaps improving their writing style.",

        "abstract":"The algorithmic facet of euclidean lattices is a frequent to ol in computer science and mathematics. It mainly relies on the LLL reduction, making w orthwile efficiency improvements. Schnorr proved that the LLL algorithm can be speeded up if one computes approximations to the underlying Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisations. Without approximations, these computations dominate the cost of the reduction. Recently, classical too ls from the field of numerical anal- ysis have been revisited and improved in order to strengthenSchnorr's approach, and further reducing the costs. We describe these developments, and sho w especially how floating-point computations may be introduced at various levels in the redu ction process.",

        "abstract":"Diffraction and holography are fertile areas for application of signal theory and processing. Recent work on 3DTV displays has posed particularly challenging signal processing problems. Various procedures to compute Rayleigh-Sommerfeld, Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction exist in the literature. Diffraction between parallel planes and tilted planes can be efficiently computed. Discretization and quantization of diffraction fields yield interesting theoretical and practical results, and allow efficient schemes compared to commonly used Nyquist sampling. The literature on computer-generated holography provides a good resource for holographic 3DTV related issues. Fast algorithms to compute Fourier, Walsh-Hadamard, fractional Fourier, linear canonical, Fresnel, and wavelet transforms, as well as optimization-based techniques such as best orthogonal basis, matching pursuit, basis pursuit etc., are especially relevant signal processing techniques for wave propagation, diffraction, holography, and related problems. Atomic decompositions, multiresolution techniques, Gabor functions, and Wigner distributions are among the signal processing techniques which have or may be applied to problems in optics. Research aimed at solving such problems at the intersection of wave optics and signal processing promises not only to facilitate the development of 3DTV systems, but also to contribute to fundamental advances in optics and signal processing theory.",

        "abstract":"Double patterning lithography is the most likely solution for 32nm and below process nodes due to its cost effectiveness. To enable this technique, layout decomposition is applied to split a layout into two non-conflicting patterns. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-hard in general, especially for layouts with random logic. Thus, high quality results are hard to be achieved in reasonable time. Previously, several graph partitioning techniques have been presented in order to speed up the process, with the tradeoff of the quality of results (QoR). We propose a graph division method that does not have this deficiency. First, we start with a conflict graph derived from a layout. Based on a data structure named SPQR-tree, the graph is divided into its triconnected components in linear time. The solutions of these components are then combined in a way that no QoR is lost. Thus, we call this method a \u201dlossless\u201d method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 5X speedup without sacrificing any QoR.",

        "abstract":"Data-driven techniques have influenced many aspects of speech and language processing. Models derived from data are generally more robust than hand-crafted systems since they better reflect the dis- tributions of the phenomena being modeled. With the availability of large spoken dialog corpora, dialog management can now reap the benefit of data-driven techniques. In this paper, we present our view of structuring human-human dialogs in order to learn mod- els for human-machine dialogs. We present the problems of dialog segmentation and dialog act labeling, develop a model for predict- ing and labeling topic segments and dialog acts and evaluate the model on customer-agent dialogs from a catalog service domain.",

        "abstract":"The impact of tele and mobile information technology will increase the need for fast access to geodata significantly in the next years. However, hitherto many problems concerning the wireless access to geodata e.g. to be used in route planning clients are not yet solved. Beside transaction management the requirements of route planning systems to GIS technology mainly concern the modelling and management of graph-based geodata. New challenges to meet are the efficient storage of routes and the supply of location-based database queries. However, today's first commercial database management systems for mobile devices do not support spatial database queries. In this article we collect requirements and present a first implementation prototype of a mobile route planning system focusing on the support of spatial database queries. First experiences with a mobile bicycle route planning client coupled with a database management system are presented. We show that at the server side the computation and storage of different route types as well as the generation of routes under consideration of semantic information like tourist information or roads with certain points of interest should make up the main functionality of such a system. The mobile client should supply database support for the location-based visualization of routes and an offline data management of route data.",

        "abstract":"A classification for mobile broadband services and applications is proposed that distinguishes between interactive and distribution services, and identifies the types of information supporting each one. A taxonomy is also proposed for applications' characterization parameters, divided into five different types: service characteristics, traffic and communications parameters, service components, and operation environments. Because the multiservice traffic analysis of a mobile broadband system, with a given mixture of applications, requires the definition of their main operation environments, the respective deployment scenarios are defined. By incorporating these classifications and available forecast information, predictions of broadband application usage in deployment scenarios such as residential, business, and industrial markets are presented",

Watermarking is achieved by modifying this vector in order to point to the centroid of a particular cell. This cell is determined according to the extract ed vector, private keys and the watermark. A dual-key system is used to reduce the chance of the removal of wat ermark. An iterative approach is used to prevent the removal of watermark by JPEG re-quantization. Experimental results show that the watermark can be detect ed when the watermarked image is further compressed using a larger scaling factor.",

        "abstract":"This paper deals with the issue of watermarking 2D-vector data (point coordinates) which are used in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The tolerance range of the coordinates is used to embed the information. As an embedding constraint no violation of the tolerance range at each point may occur. In the first step of our approach we lay a rectangular grid over the map, where the origin, the extension, and the subdivision of this grid is only known by the embedder. Based on a secret key we choose two disjunctive sets A and B of grid elements namely \"patches\". Now these selected elements are further divided into smaller subareas or \"subpatches\". In subpatches belonging to set A the distances of points to a reference line within each subpatch are decreased while the distances of subpatches of set B are unchanged. In the retrieving procedure we consider all subpatches belonging to the sets A and B and calculate for each of the two sets their sample variance. The decision whether the map is watermarked with a certain key or not is based on this feature and is made with the help of a hypothesis test. The proposed method is robust against attacks changing the coordinates within the tolerance range and against polygon simplification procedures.",

        "abstract":"Modern simulation codes often use a combination of languages and libraries for a variety of reasons including reducing time to solution, automatic parallelism when possible. portability, and modularity. We describe the process of designing a new multiscale simulation code, which takes advantage of these principles. One application of our code is high-powered laser systems. where hundreds of laser beams are concentrated on centimeter-sized targets to enable the demonstration of controlled fusion and exciting new experiments in astrophysics and high-energy-density science. Each target must be carefully analyzed so that debris and shrapnel from the tat-get will be acceptable to optics and diagnostics, creating new simulation regimes. These simulations rely on a predictive capability for determining the debris and shrapnel effects. Our new three-dimensional parallel code uses adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) combined with more standard methods based on Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) hydrodynamics to perform advanced modelling of each different target design. The AMR method provides a true multiscale simulation that allows for different physical models oil different scales. We discuss our code development strategies. The code is built oil top of the SAMRAI library (structured adaptive mesh refinement application interface) that provides scalable automatic parallelism. During the development phase of this code we have instituted testing procedures, code writing styles, and team coordination applicable to a rapidly changing source code, several dependent libraries, and a relatively small team including university collaborators with their own source and platforms. We use modern coding techniques and open source tools when possible for code management and testing including CppUnit, Subversion (and previously GNU ARCH), TiddlyWiki and group chat rooms. Additionally. we are conducting experiments aimed at providing a data set for validation of the fragmentation models.",

        "abstract":"Lattice reduction algorithms have surprisingly many applications in mathematics and computer science, notably in cryptology. On the one hand, lattice reduction algorithms are widely used in public-key cryptanalysis, for instance to attack special settings of RSA and DSA\/ECDSA. On the other hand, there are more and more cryptographic schemes whose security require that certain lattice problems are hard. In this talk, we survey lattice reduction algorithms, present their performances, and discuss the differences between theory and practice.",

        "abstract":"This paper is aimed at formally specifying and validating security-design models of an information system. It combines graphical languages and formal methods, integrating specification languages such as UML and an extension, SecureUML, with the Z language. The modeled system addresses both functional and security requirements of a given application. The formal functional specification is built automatically from the UML diagram, using our RoZ tool. The secure part of the model instanciates a generic security-kernel written in Z, free from applications specificity, which models the concepts of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). The final modeling step creates a link between the functional model and the instanciated security kernel. Validation is performed by animating the model, using the Jaza tool. Our approach is demonstrated on a case-study from the health care sector where confidentiality and integrity appear as core challenges to protect medical records.",

Our evaluations show that we can guarantee QoS without changing the basic properties of Chord significantly.",

The N-limit point and N-cluster point of an L-fuzzy net (resp. an L-fuzzy ideal), N-closed set and N-open set in an L-fuzzy topological space are defined by means of the near N-compactness, and their various properties and mutual relationships are discussed.

        "abstract":"Common ground. Shared interests. Collective goals. Much has been said about the power of technology to bring people together around commonalities to form groups, teams, and communities. Yet, the same technologies can also be used to bring together individuals with fundamentally irreconcilable differences. In these cases, the question is not how to construct systems that build on commonality, but rather how to manage artifacts that by their very nature provide affordances for conflict. In this paper we examine how Biographies of Living Persons (BLP) in Wikipedia exemplify contentious objects, both in terms of their features and their consequences. We draw from discussions of risk management and resilience to outline four approaches that groups can use to manage contentious objects (risk avoidance, risk minimization, threat reduction, and conflict management). Description of the policies, structures, and systems surrounding Biographies of Living Persons in Wikipedia illustrate how application of these approaches enable the creation and existence of large collection of contentions objects, without undermining the viability of the larger socio-technical system.",

        "abstract":"Autonomous systems with multiple sensory and effector modules face the problem of coordinating these components while fulfilling tasks such as moving towards a goal and avoiding sensed obstacles. We propose to solve this integration problem through a two-level planning dynamics. Through adequate choice of the planning variables this dynamics resides at an abstract task-related level. At the same time, stable control behavior in closed loop is granted by the stability properties of the dynamics. The capability of the system to perform stable planning, make planning decisions, and integrate redundant as well as complementary information is demonstrated by software simulations. These include the simulation of control errors on both the effector and the sensor side.",

        "abstract":"In this paper, a logarithmic method was developed to solve optimization problems containing the product of free-sign discrete functions (PFDF). The current deterministic methods used to handle these problems are based on the concept of continuous variables; therefore, the methods always transform the original model into another programming model (e.g., DC programming, convex programming) and solve them with a commercial solver. As the nature of a discrete variable is quite different from that of a continuous one, developing a novel method to address the above mentioned problems is necessary. This study proposes a concise and efficient method that linearizes PFDF term into a set of linear inequalities directly without redundant transformation. Further, the proposed method only requires the logarithmic numbers of binary variables and constraints. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed formulation significantly outperforms current approaches.",

        "abstract":"The deployment of scalable audiovisual multicast services over heterogeneous core and access networks is a challenging problem. In this article we propose E-Cast, an efficient, source-specific, scalable, overlay multicast system based on the peer-to-peer system Kademlia. This novel overlay multicast system enables IPTV multicast to be deployed as a service level infrastructure to overcome IP network multicast discontinuity in converging wired and wireless network domains. E-cast consists of a set of edge devices called E-Cast Service Node (ESN) and one managing device called E-Cast Service Manager (ESM). ESNs are distributed in the network and provide efficient video distribution services. They not only transport the media-streaming but also can cache the media files according to some given criteria. Performance evaluation using simulation and features comparison with existing proposals are also proposed.",

        "abstract":"The IBM System\/390 Parallel Sysplex allows a parallel server to grow from a single system to a configuration of 32 systems, and appear as a single image to the end user and applications. It can provide capacity growth for today's largest commercial workloads by enabling a workload to be spread transparently across a collection of systems with shared access to data. By the way of its parallel architecture and operating system support, the Parallel Sysplex offers near-linear scalability and continuous availability for customers' mission-critical applications. Parallel Sysplex optimizes responsiveness and reliability by distributing workloads across all of the processors in the Sysplex. If one or more processors fail, the workload is redistributed across the remaining processors. Because all of the processors have access to all of the data, it can provide a computing environment with near-continuous availability. Empirical performance data are used to demonstrate that Parallel Sysplex provides better scalability than a tightly-coupled multiprocessing system.",

This paper gives two new characterizations of M- and M'-convex functions generalizing Gul and Stacchetti's results on the equivalence among the single improvement condition, the gross substitutes condition and the no complementarities condition for set functions (utility functions on {0,1} vectors) as well as Fujishige and Yang's observation on the connection to M-convexity. We also discuss implications of our results in an exchange economy with indivisible goods.",

Dennoch ist es nicht m \u00a8 oglich, den Anwendungscode vollkommen frei von Datenbankaspekten zu halten, da oftmals auch die Synchronisation auf dieser Ebe- ne erfolgen muss. Um eine vollstandige Trennung von Synchronisation und Anwen- dungslogik zu erreichen - und damit die Logik \u00a8 ubersichtlicher zu gestalten -, schla- gen wir die Verwendung von Metadaten in Form von Attributen vor, mit deren Hil- fe der Code annotiert wird. Ein entsprechendes Persistenz-Framework kann dadurch zur Laufzeit sein Verhalten anpassen und die geforderten Synchronisationsaufgaben \u00a8 ubernehmen.

        "abstract":"In this paper an artificial neural network model for identifying inclusion properties based on measured biomechanical data is demonstrated. The force-displacement curves for a set of breast phantoms under different loading and exploration conditions were accumulated and analyzed. Curve features were extracted. It is successfully to formulate the relationship between the inclusion biomechanical properties and curve features. The inverse biomechanical model is then solved using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The results show that the ANN model combined with lateral exploration strategy has the capability accurately to predict the inclusion properties, such as inclusion stiffness, when the indentation depth is close to the underlying depth of the inclusion.",

        "abstract":"Semistructured data is typically represented using XML. However, little semantic information can be captured using XML. Other data models, such as the Object Relationship Attribute data model for Semistructured data (ORASS), have been introduced to represent more detailed semantic information. Automatic analysis of the data models would enable us to reveal inconsistencies both at the schema and instance levels of the semistructured data. The aim of this paper is to encode the semantics of the ORA-SS data model in the Alloy formal language and automatically validate the semistructured data design using the Alloy Analyzer. It enables us to check the consistency of an ORA-SS schema and its instances.",

        "abstract":"A web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. Recently it is in the limelight being used for implementing Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Traditionally, the web service for SOA is provisioned based on Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). In the advent of web 2.0, Representational State Transfer (REST) which focused on using the Web as it is by following its basic principles is come into being. As REST is becoming more popular, the design paradigm melted in REST makes Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) an alternative or a complement to SOA. Telco has traditionally heavy transaction systems and network control systems are managed in a closed manner. So it is not easy to provide web services. In this paper, we propose a ROA-based web service provisioning methodology and a platform architecture for Telco. We also explain the implementation of the ROA-based web service platform in KT.",

        "abstract":"We study the problem of contour tracking with binary sensors, an important problem for monitoring spatial signals and tracking group targets. In particular, we track the boundaries of the blobs of interest and capture the topological changes as the blobs merge or split. Only the nodes on the boundaries of these deformable blobs stay active and the repair cost is proportional to the size of the contour changes. Our algorithm is completely distributed, requires only local information, and yet captures the global topological properties. The algorithm performs a fundamental monitoring function and is a foundation for further information processing of spatial sensor data.",

At the end of 2009, every Belgian citizen older than 12 years will have such an eID card. In the future, usage of the eID card may be mandatory. However, irresponsible use of the card may cause harm to individuals. Currently, there exist some privacy and security problems related to the use of the eID card. This paper focuses on solutions to tackle these problems. A new authentication protocol is introduced to substantially reduce the risk of abusing the single sign-on authentication and privacy friendly identity files are proposed to improve the citizen's privacy.",

        "abstract":"This study explores the process of organizational change by examining localized social learning in organizational subunits. Specifically, we examine participation in university technology transfer, a new organizational initiative, by tracking 1,780 faculty members, examining their backgrounds and work environments, and following their engagement with academic entrepreneurship. We find that individual adoption of the new initiative may be either substantive or symbolic. Our results suggest that individual attributes, while important, are conditioned by the local work environment. In terms of personal attributes, individuals are more likely to participate if they trained at institutions that had accepted the new initiative and been active in technology transfer. In addition, we find that the longer the time that had elapsed since graduate training, the less likely the individual was to actively embrace the new commercialization norm. Considering the localized social environment, we find that when the chair of the department is active in technology transfer, other members of the department are also likely to participate, if only for symbolic reasons. We also find that technology transfer behavior is calibrated by the experience of those in the relevant cohort. If an individual can observe others with whom they identify engaging in the new initiative, then they are more likely to follow with substantive compliance. Finally, when individuals face dissonance, a situation where their individual training norms are not congruent with the localized social norms in their work environment, they will conform to the local norms, rather than adhering to the norms from their prior experience.",

        "abstract":"We have built an extension of Standard ML aimed at multicomputer platforms with distributed memories. The resulting language, paraML, differs from other extensions by including and differentiating both coarse-grained and fine-grained parallelism. The basis for coarse-grained parallelism in paraML is process creation where there is no sharing of data, with communication between processes via asynchronous message passing to typed ports. Fine-grained parallelism may be introduced in a number of ways; we have investigated data parallelism and light-weight threads as per Concurrent ML. Our experiments with data parallelism and algorithmic skeletons illustrate that libraries can be constructed to hide process creation and message passing from the user. Furthermore, since processes may be arbitrarily nested, such libraries can be linked together in program hierarchies, allowing the integration of a range of parallel granularities to be used within a program in a modular and efficient manner. Performance analysis of the system is encouraging, with good speedup for a range of problems. Optimisation of process creation and message passing have lowered the size at which paraML becomes cost-effective against sequential implementations of ML for scientific problems.",
