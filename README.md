# Predicting Academic Paper Citations from Social Media Exposure

This project explores how keywords and abstract content influenced by social media visibility relate to citation counts of academic papers.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
- Can keyword prominence and abstract content predict future citations?
- Can social media APIs (Twitter, LinkedIn) enhance feature extraction?

## 🛠 Methods
- Extracted keywords from abstracts using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
- Translated social media exposure to keyword-level signals
- Applied classification/regression models to predict citation trends

## 📈 Results
- Identified top influencing keywords
- Developed multi-class citation range prediction

## 🧰 Tools Used
`Python`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `BERT`, `TF-IDF`, `NLP`, `Citation Analysis`

## 📁 Files
- `citation_predictor.ipynb`: modeling notebook
- `data/`: preprocessed paper metadata
